{"sample_id": 6424, "text": "Matt Danmor thinks he's lucky. Not many people survive a near death accident with nothing more than a bout of amnesia, a touch of clumsiness and the conviction that the technician who did the MRI had grey skin and hooves. Still, it takes time to recover from trauma like that, especially when the girl who was in the accident with you disappears into thin air. Especiallywhen the shrinks keep telling you she's just a figment of your imagination. So when the girl turns up months later looking ravishing, and wanting to carry on where they left off, Matt's troubled life starts looking up. But he hasn't bargained for the baggage that comes with Silvy, like the fact she isn't really an English language student, or even a girl. Underneath her traffic stopping exterior is something else altogether, something involving raving fanatics bent on human sacrifice, dimensionally challenged baked bean tins, a vulture with a penchant for profanity, and a security agent for the Dept of Fimmigration (that's Fae immigration for those of you not in the know) called Kylah with the most amazing gold-flecked eyes The 400 Lb Gorilla is caustic, (vampire-free) introduction to the Hipposync Archives: Contemporary fantasy at its sparkling best.\nDC Farmer began writing psycho-thrillers while his children slept. They grew up\u0097and so did he. Now he writes contemporary urban fantasy under the umbrella of the Hipposync Archives. When he's not stringing sentences together he still practices medicine; a career which, over the years, has taken him to London, Oxford and Bristol. In 1986, he dropped anchor in West Wales where he now lives with his wife and two dogs, in the shadow of the Black Mountains, making things up as he goes along.\nThe 400lb. Gorilla 4.3 out of 5 based on 0 ratings. 3 reviews.\nMatt is met with a horrible accident and considers himself lucky to even have survived that. But, after that accident, things get strange for Matt. His med school education is paused and he now works as a porter in the hospital. There are a couple of people in the hospital, who always seem to give some complications to Matt. And his girlfriend, Silvy, who was at the time of accident, is considered to be a figment of Matt's imagination by the psychologist, as there is no proof that such person existed. As these were not enough, Matt starts seeing strange things in his life. Soon, his life is tangled with some otherworldly beings and Matt has no clue how to take this new journey. The 400lb. Gorilla is a fun and interesting urban fantasy novel. There are so many characters with very different personalities, but well thought out. Matt, Kylah, Porter and Rimsplitter are all adorable. The plot is different than the regular urban fantasy ones and the dialogues are witty. Personally, I loved the snarkiness in the dialogues and enjoyed the journey of the innocent Matt. I kept wondering about the title of the story throughout the book, but I am not going to spoil it for you. It will be interesting when you read it for yourself. Love this and am definitely recommending it to all fantasy lovers. Even if you are not a lover of fantasy, give it a try, as it's something different from the regular ones.\nWhen Matt survives a car accident that leaves him with head trauma, his life takes a down hill turn. He remembers his girlfriend Silvy being in the car but there was no evidence of that, leading his psychiatrist to deduce her as a figment of his imagination. When Matt starts seeing deformed creatures, he just thinks that he is hallucinating. But when Silvy suddenly walks back into his life, he discovers that there is more than hallucinations going on. This was such a great fantasy read. The way the plot was written, I never knew what was coming next. I like that the characters were a mixture of opposites, bringing balance to the structure of the story. With humor throughout, and a bully to contend with, this became a very satisfying read.\nThe 400 Lb Gorilla is a masterful urban fantasy with plenty of humor, classic allusions, and experienced medical framework. It is the first book in what is said to be a series entitled &ldquo;The Hipposync Archives,&rdquo; and it is clear that this fun, witty, and thrilling book is the beginning of a line of texts that are a little bit &lsquo;Dr. Who,&rsquo; a little bit &lsquo;Scrubs,&rsquo; a little bit Terry Gilliam and Terry Pratchett, and a little bit &lsquo;Dresden Files.&rsquo; When Matt Danmor survives an accident he remembers very little of, and his rocky relationship ends with his girlfriend disappearing, he is shocked when she shows up again with an intense fear of iron and an intense love of kissing. There begins a terrifying adventure to discover his new trans-dimensional self where creatures both literal and spiritual are all vying to kill and digest him before he is able to do it himself. With fun characters, dizzying trips in and out of reality, trans dimensional travel, and bureaucracy that is&hellip; well&hellip; actually, hilariously similar to real life, Jones takes us on a fantastic adventure that opens a new staggering wonder that could occur in everyday life if only by chance. What is most impressive to me about this book is its mastery of humor and execution. It is a tightly woven plot that is just as fun to get through as it is to marvel at his occasional fun turns of phrase. There are a few kitschy similes, but that adds to the humor and charm of the piece. His allusions throughout are wonderful for fanboys of classicism, but like Rowling one doesn&rsquo;t need a background in it to still enjoy the book. The book is well written, organized, designed, and edited, and it is refreshing that this small press release is so well executed from beginning to end."}

{"sample_id": 3206, "text": "Yikes! It's the last day of November and the Christmas countdown begins in earnest starting tomorrow. Here are some ideas from last week's party that might come in handy!\nFrom Hazel and Gold Designs , this gorgeous inlaid wood Christmas tree tray! I have a friend w/ mad woodworking skills and I have to show him this!\nRepurpose and Upcycle shared her beautiful rustic farmhouse decor with links to some of the DIYs. Love this vignette!\nHow much fun are these Edible Candles from All That's Jas? Would make a great centerpiece that you get to eat as dessert!\nPrintables make seasonal decor so simple. This one from My Busy Beehives is ready to print and frame!\nI will start decking my halls this coming weekend and wanted to add some new items to my Christmas decor. This sign was easy to make starting with a ready to decorate sign I found at Michaels 70% off!\nImages / Phrase to cut. The ornaments and \"BELIEVE\" phrase were in my library, previously purchased from the Silhouette online store.\nSize and cut your images and text. I used the \"BELIEVE\" and ornament images I got from the Silhouette online store. For the rest of the sentiment, I just chose fonts from my library.\nThe ornament image is designed with the snowflakes to be cut separately and layered. I wanted to change that up so I un-grouped everything and then put the snowflakes inside the ornament.\nOnce you have your images cut out, then take a deep breath, have a Harry Potter marathon on in the background, and \"proceed to weed\" your vinyl. Once that's done then apply the transfer tape and prepare to apply to your sign.\nI applied the \"BELIEVE\" vinyl first, then the rest of my phrase and finally the ornaments. It has a vintage / farmhouse feel to it!\nFrom our home to yours, wishing you a very Happy Thanksgiving filled with family, friends, food, and lots of love and laughs.\nHi all and welcome to another week's fun of sharing creativity. Can you believe this time next week all the hours of cooking and prepping and depending on where you are maybe eating will be over? One week to Thanksgiving! If you're still getting ready to host, here are some ideas to inspire you.\nHere's a lovely tablescape from The Handmade Home. Love the Moscow Mule mugs and the centerpiece basket filled with white gourds and candles! Head on over because she's also got some free downloadable place cards!\nYou still have time to add a Fall themed pillow. I especially love the non-traditional color of this one from Kathleen at Our Hopeful Home.\nIf you're in a place where weather permits hosting an outdoor dinner, check out this gorgeously rustic Boho Chic idea from Birds Party.\nFinally, from Carol at The Red Painted Cottage comes this gorgeous thick wood tray complete with a tutorial ( bottom of post) so you can make your own or maybe one to give as a holiday gift!\nThe first thing I'll say is, if you've wanted to try heat transfer vinyl and been intimidated so keep putting it off because you think it's too complicated ....DON'T. Because that was me, I used it for the first time and was kicking myself saying \"Why didn't I do this sooner?\"\nThere's no logic behind why I thought that, just did. But I finally decided to go for it and it's a game changer. I decided to start with something simple: a pillow. I also decided to go w/ a design that didn't matter if I messed up the mirroring because I kept reading how key that is to using HTV.\nI'm not going to describe pillow construction. My sewing skills extend to four straight lines.\nThe front side goes down. When you put your vinyl on your cutting mat, you're cutting from the underside of the vinyl. It took me one attempt to figure this out. HTV comes with a clear plastic liner, its own transfer tape in a way which is the side you want to touch your cutting mat.\nSee how the matte side is \"up\"? That's what you want. The shiny side is what will go on your project and this is a shot during the weeding process. About that. I HATE WEEDING. If you're not a vinyl user, weeding is removing the parts of the vinyl you don't need to reveal the image. This stuff just pulled away so easily!\nThis is a (bad) picture of the front / shiny side that will go on your project. Once your project is weeded, it's already on the equivalent of the transfer tape so it's super easy to lay down on your material.\nThe heat process is more press than iron.\nWhen applying your iron, it's more of a press and pick up than slide your iron around. Press, hold, pick up, move to next session. Now, I did do some slight gliding but the main process is press and lift. This is why you'll see serious HTV people use a heat press which is like a vinyl panini maker.\nYou will use a pressing cloth on top of the plastic carrier sheet when applying heat. This is good. What's not good is deciding to use said cloth directly on top of the vinyl when you're just trying to make extra sure that you've applied enough heat. This will result in the weave of your pressing cloth ( mine was a scrap of a flour sack towel) transferring to your vinyl. Now as it turned out this was OK w/ my project because the texture looked kinda cool but in general, if you don't want this, keep the plastic from the vinyl between the surface of your project and your pressing cloth!\nOnce my image was applied, I went about construction my pillow. And voila!\nIf you're using words or letters, you will need to \"mirror\" (flip) your project before you cut it or your letters will be backwards when you apply. I chose this image because it didn't matter if I messed that up since it was the same either way. As it turned out, the Cameo 3 asks you if you want to do this because you will have selected the HTV material in your cut settings.\nIf you're not using a full sheet of vinyl, you need to pay attention to which side of the mat you put your vinyl on, again because of the mirroring. So if you place a smaller than 12x12 piece on your mat on the left side, choose mirror, the Cameo at any rate will actually cut from the right side of your mat so put your vinyl on the right side of the mat!\nI'm happy with my first attempt and have a new addition to my Thanksgiving decor.\nSide Table. Found these pumpkin signs last year 90% off after Halloween. Painted and applied glitter vinyl. Turkeys were 75% off at JoAnn one year. Painted w/ glitter paint.\nMarc Roberts Harvest Fairy. I have a collection of Christmas fairies but found this Fall themed one on sale one year.\nAs much as I dislike eating anything pumpkin, I love making pumpkin projects. Go figure! I thought I'd round up some of my favorite pumpkin transformations.\nI did these for Halloween but can work for Thanksgiving / Fall. Faux pumpkin, silk leaves, rolled paper roses and a drawer pull.\nMore tissue paper and Mod Podge.\nDrop cloth, fabric and leather scraps.\nI hope you're all enjoying this Saturday, doing whatever fills your soul. This week's party continues here.\nI saw this quote somewhere online as I was hopping around and don't remember where but it resonated with me so I decided to make a printable.\nIt's sized 8x10 so click on whichever image to bring to full resolution. Graphics are from a Rustic Wreath collection I downloaded from Creative Market.\nHappy Friday Eve all and welcome to another party. Hope you've all had a great week.\nI'm pleased to announce the winner of my recent Paperless Post giveaway ( winner was randomly selected via Rafflecopter) is Kim who has been notified via email. Thanks to everyone who participated.\nOK who else has never heard of an \"Ears and Beers\" party (as the name implies, it involves corn and beer)? I love hosting this party because I learn new things all the time. Jenny from Jenny Louise Marie shared how she hosted one of these and you really need to check it out to see all the amazing things she did and incporated popcorn, candy corn, corn tortilla chips, Mexican street corn, candy corn jello shots and of course, beer!\nShe sent her guests home with these corn themed favors that could easily work for Thanksgiving.\nMy son is coming home for Thanksgiving so I must have beer on my mind since he is a craft beer aficionado. I know not everyone drinks beer so you could easily do this w/ your beverage of choice , but Milena and Chris from Craftbeering came up with a fun way to count down until Christmas especially since there are many seasonal brews that are only out a certain times of the year.\nYou could even have a different flavor for each day!\nTis the season to be wreathy and Cathy from Vintage Paint and More has got you covered.\nFinally, if you are looking for pie alternatives for Thanksgiving or for any time, check out this gorgeous Apple Galette from Mrs. Kringles Kitchen!\nOK now on to this week's party!"}

Feels like a tall BMX ride, or a scooter with a seat. Stiff, quick handling. Turn on the button, twist the throttle and the electricity takes over. It will let you cruise comfortably on the flats and on slight inclines. Switch to e-assist mode and you just pedal and the motor works on back-up, giving you much better climbing ability.\nHard to beat for the money. It's not fast. If you want fast, you'll need to get a Metro, or a bike with a bigger motor.\nThe Edge seems to be a great flatlander rider and commuter. Fold it up on the bus or train.

{"sample_id": 6646, "text": "In SecureWorks\u2019 2017 Cybersecurity Threat Insights Report, we found those cracks are often the result of failing to implement basic\u2014 the effective combination of people, processes and technologies to protect systems and data. Strong security hygiene requires knowing your assets, your data, and the controls protecting them. Yet in the report, our examination of 163 incident response engagements during the first half of 2016 uncovered failures ranging from poor patch management to a failure to protect the extended enterprise to ineffective preparation for incident response.\nTo understand what organizations need to do to prioritize the right areas for security spending and what can be done to more effectively prevent, remediate and respond to threats, cybersecurity leaders need to start with the fundamentals.\nWhile much of the media focus is often on sophisticated, targeted attacks, the vast majority of the incidents for which Secure- Works was engaged in the first half of 2016 (88 percent) were opportunistic attacks that did not target a specific organization. Among the incidents in the report in which the initial access vector was known, phishing was used 38 percent of the time, making it the most common attack methodology used by attackers. Scan and exploit was the second most common at 22 percent, while strategic web compromises and credential abuse comprised 21 percent and 15 percent, respectively.\nRemovable media was involved in four percent of the incidents.\nIn terms of defense, the implication here is clear: organizations need to put an emphasis on addressing the challenge posed by phishing. Part of that requires educating and training employees to spot phishing emails when they hit their inboxes. Often, there are telltale signs\u2014misspellings, requests for the recipient to do something out of the norm, etc.\u2014but sometimes there are not. In targeted attacks, spear-phishing emails can be even more sneaky than most. It is common for advanced threat groups to perform extensive reconnaissance on their targets before launching an attack, allowing them to create convincing emails that take into account details such as the recipient\u2019s job duties and what IT assets and data they have access to. With that kind of information at an attacker\u2019s disposal, it is likely that someone in the organization will fall victim, making anti-phishing technologies like email filtering critical.\nPhishing can often lead to credential theft. Once a phisher has a victim\u2019s username, password or authentication information, they can abuse it to gain access to an account, service or network and take other actions\u2014including data theft. In one incident noted in the report, a threat actor compromised a third-party organization providing help desk services to its true target. After compromising the third-party environment, the threat actor accessed their actual target. Once inside, the adversary gained access to administrator accounts, used them to access Citrix servers, and stole credentials from those servers for other systems. Protecting user credentials and enforcing best practices in regards to passwords/passphrases is a critical part of security. Another critical part is controlling user access and privileges. To prevent potential abuse by attackers or insider threats, user privileges should be limited to the lowest level necessary\u2014 a strategy that could cause culture clashes between the organization and users accustomed to not being limited, but also one that could impair an attack from spreading if a machine is compromised.\nStrategic web compromises involve attackers infecting legitimate websites their targets are likely to visit in hopes of infecting their computers when they do. These types of drive-by download attacks are particularly sneaky because they take advantage of the trust the visitor has in the site. Although they sometimes use zerodays, the vulnerabilities are likely known issues the attacker is hoping the target has not yet patched. As a result, protecting against these types of attacks starts with an effective patch management strategy that identifies the vulnerabilities affecting your IT environment and rolls out the appropriate updates as promptly as possible.\nOrganizations should scan their networks and develop an inventory of their software and devices, then prioritize their patching according to the risk of an attack and the damage it could do if successful. In addition, vulnerability management extends to weaving security into the app development process and ensuring the safety of non-commodity code developed internally or by a third-party partner.\nOf course, corporate security teams are hardly the only ones doing vulnerability scans. In the case of the recent Wanna- Cry ransomware attacks for example, the threat actors scanned Internet IP addresses for machines vulnerable to a Microsoft Windows vulnerability. This type of highvolume scanning of Internet-facing systems is a common way for threat actors to find systems they can exploit, and as noted above, was observed in nearly a quarter of the incidents examined in the report. One of the reasons the ransomware spread so quickly was that many organizations did not promptly apply Microsoft\u2019s update despite it having been available since March. Buying the latest technology will not solve the problem posed by an unsecure Web server left accessible via the Internet.\nThe bottom line is that organizations need to take a risk-based approach to security that goes beyond regulatory compliance. Our Threat Insights Report outlines a number of recommendations.\nUnderstand the extended enterprise. Take a data-centric approach. Define your key assets, know where they reside and who has access to them, including third parties.\nIncrease visibility. By collecting and monitoring security events, you will be able to reduce the time it takes to detect and respond to incidents as well as identify trends within the infrastructure. At a minimum, maintain logs on the following systems for 13 months: firewall, IDS/IPS, DNS, VPN, Active Directory, Web Services and critical servers and systems.\nBuild a culture of security. Everyone within the organization must take responsibility for protecting information. This involves getting buy-in from C-level leaders as well as other parts of the business outside IT in order to sell the importance of smart security behaviors.\nTrain your users. Employees unfortunately remain the weakest link. Phishing and social engineering remain popular for attackers seeing to infect enterprises and SMBs alike. Training employees to spot suspicious behavior can significantly improve your ability to block malicious activity.\nToo often, the answer for these challenges is to buy the latest technology. However, to truly improve their security, chief information security officers need to focus more on people and processes. One of the mistakes many CISOs make is to take a compliance-first approach to security. Taking that type of checkbox approach does not best serve the organization. When it comes to cybersecurity, compliance should be thought of as a floor as opposed to a ceiling. For example, Secure- Works has talked to security teams at financial institutions who spent as much as 40 percent of their time on compliance initiatives rather than security initiatives that matter to their organizations. Ironically, putting a strong emphasis on security will address most compliance requirements.\nCybersecurity is not a problem that can be solved with technology alone. Developing an effective security strategy means understanding your needs, where your critical data and assets are, and what the risk levels are to that information and those devices. It means training employees, building an effective patch management program, and operationalizing threat intelligence to harden your defenses. It means implementing strategies like strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to control access to critical systems. Whether sophisticated attackers are at your doorstep or not, it won\u2019t take any sophistication to break in if the door is unlocked.\nThis article originally appeared in the August 2017 issue of Security Today."}

{"sample_id": 2308, "text": "N.B. If any minutes were taken of the meeting in 1985 then they have long since been lost. These two articles, authored by Katherine, cover all of the content of her talk, and more.\nAs anthropologists, most of us would agree with Bruner that \"our first responsibility is to respect people's accounts of their experiences as they choose to present them\" (1983:9). However, those of us interested in historical anthropology face a special challenge since we are rarely able to draw upon indigenous accounts of everyday life. Even when we are able to use such texts, the problem of ethnographic authority remains (Clifford 1988:8; Clifford and Marcus 1986). Considerable work is being done in historical anthropology in reconstructing indigenous histories by using the early narratives of Western observers. However, such efforts have obvious problems of observer bias (see Cohn 1987:136-171; Said 1978; Savage 1984). Furthermore, as in the descriptions discussed in this article, the outside observers have sometimes recorded opposing opinions. How are we, as anthropologists writing today, to assess such conflicting appraisals? Using the case of textiles in 19th-century northern Thailand, I should like to suggest that by reconstructing the political economy of a society, we can evaluate contradictory historical descriptions.\nFrom Veblen (1912) and Simmel (1957) to Weiner and Schneider (1989), an appreciation of the varied manner in which textiles symbolize social distinctions has been longstanding. As Bourdieu has written of symbolic goods in general, textiles can be an integral part of the \"infinitely varied art of marking distances\" (1984:66; see also Barthes 1984; Sahlins 1976). Often the distinctions are extremely subtle. Writing of the use of fashion, Barthes notes the importance of details as \"concentrated meaning\" (1984:185). For Barthes, just a detail can change an object's meaning: \"a little nothing that changes everything; those little nothings that can do everything\" (1984:243). However, more than just symbolizing distinctions, textiles have also been shown to constitute and consolidate social differences through their often vital role in a society's political economy. In his pioneering article on tributary textiles in the Inca kingdom, Murra notes not only that \"no political, military, social, or religious event was complete without textiles being volunteered or bestowed, burned, exchanged, or sacrificed,\" but also that cloth served as \"a primary source of state revenues\" (1962:722).\ninsights into the semiotics of consumption and an important methodology for historical anthropology.\nOthers have made a similar point (see Schneider 1987 for an excellent review of the cultural, economic, and political significance of cloth). As Weiner and Schneider summarize, architects of centralizing polities have awed spectators with sartorial splendor, strategically distributed beautiful fabrics amongst clients, and exported the textile output of royal and peasant workshops to earn foreign exchange\" (1989:2).\nContradictory assessments of dress also occur in 19th-century descriptions of northern Thai dress. The anonymous author of one of the earliest surviving accounts remarked on the lack of class distinction in women's clothing: \"It is curious to notice the uniformity and universality of the female dress. The higher classes vary the style a little by inserting a very showy strip of wrought silk next above the bottom piece\" (Bangkok Recorder 1866). Twenty years later, an American missionary working in northern Thailand wrote in almost identical wording: \"Rich and poor all dress alike, except that the higher classes vary the universal style a little by inserting a very showy strip of wrought silk into the skirt near the bottom\" (Cort 1886:348).\nThus, depending upon the archival source, contemporary scholars can reach opposing assessments of the character of these earlier societies. Research on textiles in mainland Southeast Asia is just beginning (see Brown 1980; Cheesman 1988; Fraser-Lu 1988; Lefferts 1988, 1990; Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman 1987). Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman's Lanna Textiles: Yuan, Lue, Lao (1987) is the only full-length work on textiles in northern Thailand; as such it is an important preliminary study, especially useful for describing some of the items woven and the techniques used. In this article, I examine the broader social context of textile consumption and production, drawing upon two major kinds of sources, archival and oral. The archival sources include consular reports (primarily British), 19th century newspaper accounts, travelogues, and works by American missionaries. In addition I have interviewed hundreds of villagers over the age of 80 living throughout the Chiang Mai Valley of northern Thailand.5 I use archival sources primarily for insight into the consumption, production, and acquisition of textiles by the elite; I rely more heavily on oral histories for insights into the everyday life of villagers. Based upon an understanding of the social processes of textile production and consumption, I argue that the controversy generated by the contradictory opinions of certain 19th century observers of northern Thai society can be resolved in favor of those who asserted that there were dramatic differences of dress and class in the northern Thai semiotics of consumption.\nThe Chiang Mai Valley was the site of the largest and most important of the northern Thai kingdoms. These kingdoms were located in the region today called northern Thailand but called \"Western Laos\" by 19th century missionaries and other foreign observers. The courts of the various principalities were located in the mountain valleys of Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Lampang, Phrae, Nan, and Chiang Rai, each today serving as a provincial capital. Although these kingdoms were independent, they had been tributary to the neighboring kingdom of Burma for several hundred years. During the 19th century, they were tributary to the central Thai court at Bangkok; thereafter they were incorporated into Thailand.\nThis article is divided into two parts. In the first, I examine the cultural significance of textile consumption in 19th century northern Thailand. I present some of the surviving descriptions of dress, ranging from the daily wear of commoners to the state robes of the ruling lords, and subsequently expand the discussion from dress to other applications of textiles, arguing that there were dramatic differences between peasants and lords in this broader sphere as well. In the second part of the article, I describe how this differentiation between elites and commoners was revealed in the social process of textile production. Focusing on the two most important textiles used; cotton and silk, I consider the overall importance of textiles in the political economy of these northern Thai kingdoms, noting the role of tribute and slave labor in the acquisition of textiles by the elite.\nPrevious studies have shown that 19th-century northern Thai society was divided into three major social statuses: the aristocrats (jao), the freeholders (phrai), and the slaves (khiikhaa). The aristocracy was internally differentiated by economic and political power. The greatest power and prestige were concentrated in those lords who occupied the five top positions in each of the kingdoms, while lesser members of the aristocracy whose inheritances had dwindled were barely separable from the peasantry at large. Free villagers were all liable to perform corv\u00e9e labor and pay tribute to the ruling lords, but they were internally differentiated according to economic class. The wealthiest villagers rivaled many members of the aristocracy; in fact, many had royal titles and intermarried with the lower levels of the aristocracy. Villagers spanned the economic continuum, from those with land and numerous animals down to those who were destitute or landless beggars. The difference between slaves and free villagers was also often a gray area. Elite slaves sometimes worked very closely with their lords and received more benefits than ordinary commoners. On the other hand, the conditions for ordinary slaves were generally worse than those for commoners since the former were at the mercy of the lords. (For more on 19th century northern Thai social structure, see Bowie 1988; Calavan 1974; Ganjanapan 1984.) Nonetheless, although portions of this social spectrum overlapped, there were significant differences in lifestyle from one end of the spectrum to the other.\nTo give an idea of the purchasing power of a rupee at this time, some indications of wage rates are suggestive. Although very few statistics on northern Thai wage labor rates survive, I was able to find three references in the archival sources.16 According to the British trade report of 1894, porters were paid 12 to 15 rupees per month, assuming they carried an average load of 15 to 20 viss; about 54 to 73 pounds (Archer 1895). Some figures on the wages paid to laborers in the teak industry also survive. According to W. J. Archer, the British vice consul, Khamu workers who could once be hired for 40 to 60 rupees a year (and their food) could in 1894 no longer \"be had under Rs. 70 to Rs. 90 a year\" (1895). Writing five years later, Acting Consul J. Stewart Black gave somewhat lower wage figures, while also lamenting the increasing costs. He noted that Khamu workers were paid 30 to 50 rupees per annum, in addition to their food, which cost about 5 rupees per month, or an additional 60 rupees per year. Black wrote that in 1899 some teak laborers were being paid as much as 120 rupees (food included) and went on to castigate the native villagers for their indolence, commenting that \"not even the attraction of what is to him [sic] a small fortune will induce them to undergo for any length of time the hard labour and isolation of forest work\" (1 900).17 Thus, forest workers in the teak industry were earning anywhere from 90 to 120 rupees per year (including the value of their food), or about 7 to 10 rupees per month. Such wages paid to forest workers were considered a \"small fortune.\" Although the wages paid to porters were higher, it should be noted that portering such heavy loads required tremendous stamina and could be done by only the strongest villagers. Furthermore, such employment was seasonal.\nAccording to oral histories, the wages paid to agricultural workers were less. Many villagers cited rates of one win (approximately one-seventh of a rupee) per day for agricultural labor at the turn of the 20th century.18 Archival sources suggest that wages for teak workers averaged one-quarter to one-third of a rupee per day and those for porters averaged half a rupee per day. Villagers also recalled that in the early 20th century one rupee could buy a full set of clothing, including a homespun shirt and pair of pants or skirt.\nClearly, the aristocracy's most luxurious clothes were not likely to serve as daily casual wear. Nonetheless they marked a significant distinction in purchasing power and social status between the elite and ordinary villagers. A tin jok skirt border that cost 60 rupees represented at least four months' wages for the best-paid porter and over a year's wages for agricultural workers. Everyday peasant dress already represented anywhere from two to seven days' wages and thus constituted a considerable expense for the ordinary wage laborer.\nThe ruling lords of the northern Thai kingdom also had distinctive regalia, including umbrellas and spittoons. Whether a formal sumptuary code existed is, as I mentioned earlier, unclear. However, even without the evidence of sumptuary laws, I believe that there is considerable indication of significant class differentiation through dress.19 With the exception of state robes and regalia of rank, differences in dress may well have formed a continuum of wealth rather than a clear-cut differentiation based on status. Poorer members of the aristocracy, less able to afford the most elaborate of clothes, would have blended with those below them. Conversely, wealthier members of the rural elite, especially those who had intermarried with the lower ranks of the aristocracy, would have dressed more ornately. Nonetheless, overall, when one considers the cost of elite dress in light of the economic situation of poor villagers who were begging, stealing, or patching their simple clothing, a dramatic distinction emerges.\nTextiles were used not only for dress but also for a variety of household items and on various ritual occasions. Such uses of textiles also revealed considerable differences according to wealth. Although the poorest villagers often did without, ordinary villagers used textiles for making mattress and pillow covers, blankets, bed sheets, and mosquito nets. In general the mattress and pillow covers were plain indigo or black with red stripes or trim. Bed sheets were plain white or white with a red stripe or checked pattern; fancier sheets had embroidery and in some cases more complex weaves. Mosquito nets were woven on special large looms, and many informants complained about how heavy homespun cotton mosquito nets were to wash.\nCloth also figured importantly in the lives and rites of the elite. In addition to owning more and fancier clothes, the elite had more and better household items. Instead of just having enough mattresses, pillows, and other bedding items for the family, wealthier families had additional bedding sets for guests. Furthermore, the guest bedding was considered an object of display and so was more likely to have embroidered ends and complex, time-consuming weaves. Even today wealthy village families usually have wood cabinets with glass doors along the wall of the main room of their home to showcase guest bedding sets.\nThe possession of ornate pillows was another particularly significant attribute of elite households. Although Thais had a variety of pillows, the prestige pillows were usually triangular and were used for daytime reclining. Their importance was highlighted in a British official's passing remark that such pillows were \"to be seen in every house of any pretensions\" (Lowndes 1871).25 Furnishing their palaces, the northern Thai princes displayed numerous luxury items such as foreign-made weapons, chandeliers, mirrors, lanterns, curtains, reclining pillows, and even imported carpets (Taylor 1888-1930:73; Younghusband 1888:63-64). In 1830 Richardson noted the presence of Indian and Chinese carpets (1829-36:63), and in 1885 Ernest Satow recorded that the ruling lord of Chiang Mai had European furniture and \"a number of gaudy Brussels carpets\" (1885-86:51).\nThe full extent of the differences between commoners and aristocracy was most visible when members of the ruling elite traveled in state or participated in public ceremonies. Royal barges had large cloth canopies: the royal barge of the central Thai king, according to one observer, featured \"a canopy of cloth of gold where the King sits on a golden throne wearing a gold embroidered coat and golden shoes\" (Dodd 1923:289). The royal entourage often consisted of scores of boats, the rowers all clad in matching uniforms. The elite also traveled by horse or elephant, the animals gaily festooned with decorative textiles. On state occasions, the highest ranks of the nobility used gold and silver decorative caparisons. Mary Cort noted that the gold elephant trappings were \"worth thousands,\" whereas the silver trappings were \"worth hundreds\" of rupees (Cort 1886:349).\nIn addition to making public prestations such as those at the Kathin ceremonies, the elite would have given considerable amounts of textile goods away during any other life-cycle or calendrical ceremonies they might hold. Thai ceremonials usually included a merit-making component in which gifts, including monastic robes and embroidered pillows, were given as offerings to the monks (see Davis 1984). Archival sources also note the use of textiles as gifts to visiting dignitaries: the gifts given to Satow, a British official, by the ruling chief of Lampang included velvet mattresses, pillows adorned with Chinese brocade, and silk skirts (Satow 1885- 86:206). Thus, not only did the peasants and the lords differ considerably in terms of dress and household possessions, but they also differed in the extent to which they donated textiles on ritual occasions.\nIn this article thus far I have depicted significant differences between the elite's and the peasants' uses of textiles. I have described a range of dress: from the stolen and the hand-me-down, from the threadbare and the patched, from the simple cottons of commoners to the state robes of the ruling lords. I have also outlined some of the different uses of textiles in village households as opposed to the court. Here, I should like to show how the differentiation was manifested not simply in the consumption of textiles but also in their production.\nAs will become clear, both accounts are true; the differences lie in the type of fabric being woven.\nMost clothing was made from cotton. However, contrary to what is commonly assumed, weaving was not a universal household industry; only certain villagers in certain villages wove (see Bowie 1988, 1992). The weaving of simple cotton cloth was spread quite widely throughout the Chiang Mai Valley, and certain districts were especially known for their concentrations of weavers. Those districts that had a reputation for cotton weaving in the past, especially the San Kamphaeng and Bo sang districts, have maintained their reputations down to the present. Furthermore, oral histories reveal weaving to have been a highly specialized activity, with different villagers involved in the different phases of production. By far the most commonly produced cloth was a plain white cotton, often later dyed with indigo. The villagers most likely to produce such cloth were the poorer ones, who wove both for their own household needs and for sale or hire. Such village weavers were more likely to find weaving an onerous obligation from which others were freed.\nFrom the simplest and plainest of homespun white cloth to the most elaborate designs using imported fibers, the value of the fabric gradually increased. Striped or plaid cloth involved more work and skill, in both weaving and dyeing, than plain cloth and was consequently valued more highly. Cloth woven with imported threads, most often used for women's phaa sins, was more expensive than the domestic handspun cotton. The wealthier the village weaver, the more likely she was to weave the more time-consuming decorative items such as colored skirts or striped sheets. The more elaborate the design, the more likely the weaver was weaving for pleasure with a \"cool heart.\"\nThe more complex the weave, the more likely that the weaver was affiliated in some manner with the aristocracy, as war captive, slave, or member of the court. Virtually each of the areas known for weaving is associated with an ethnic minority brought into the Chiang Mai Valley as war captives sometime during the 19th century. Baan Ton Hen is a Khyyn village; San Kamphaeng (particularly around the original district town of Baan Oon) is also known as a Khyyn area. The Khyyn are a population who originally lived in the Chiang Tung area: Chiang Mai led attacks on Chiang Tung in 1849, 1852-53, and 1854, and it seems people were brought back on these occasions (Wilson and Hanks 1985:29). Over half of the people living in the Lamphun region are said to have descended from war captives (Freeman 1910:100). Chom Thong town has a Lawa population, many of whom served as temple slaves. Unfortunately, I was unable to acquire any information about the ethnic background of villagers in Baan Aen since the entire village was forced to relocate when a hydroelectric dam was built.\nUnlike villagers, who had to weave, trade for, or buy their clothing, the ruling lords were able to extract raw cotton, woven cloth, and dyestuffs as tribute. Their ability to levy tribute on broad sectors of the population provided the aristocracy with a quantity of cotton cloth no single producer could hope to match. Interestingly, the majority of villagers who sent cotton or cloth as tribute appear to have been hilltribe populations, such as the Karen and the Mussur (today more commonly called the Lahu). One of the Karen villages that Captain Thomas Lowndes visited in 1871 had just taken its year's taxes to Chiang Mai: \"it consisted of Rupees 2, 2 blankets, and 40 viss of cotton\" (1871). Richardson also noted tribute of cloth paid by the Karen during his travels in 1830 (1829-36:37, 45). Captain McLeod found that the KaKuis had to make presents of mats and cloths to the lords (1836:57). McGilvary commented that much of the raw cotton being purchased by the Yunnanese traders came from the Mussur; although he did not specifically mention tribute, it is likely that the Mussur too would have been expected to offer tribute to the ruling lords in the form of raw cotton or finished cloth. While the aristocracy were able to make apparently generous donations on ritual occasions, much of what they gave was in fact the contribution of others.\nThus, the aristocracy appear to have been able to extract raw cotton, simple cotton cloth, and complex cotton weaves through political means. Tribute afforded them both raw cotton and cotton cloth, and the labor of war captives seems to have provided them with complex weaves such as tin jok skirt borders. Although silk was considered a more valuable fabric, cotton cloth nonetheless had a variety of uses in royal households. The tin jok borders, even those made of cotton, would have marked their wearers as wealthier than ordinary villagers, who only wore plain skirt borders. Possession of textiles ranging from mattresses to elephant headpieces made from complex woven cotton would have similarly served to add to the prestige of their owners. Such cloth could be used as rewards for favored underlings or as gifts for visitors. In addition, cotton cloth made possible the public display of largess involved in merit-making ceremonies, since monks' robes were typically made from cotton.\nIt is also possible that royalty were involved in the cotton trade. There was considerable demand for raw cotton by Yunnanese traders and some demand for cotton cloth in Burma (Bowie 1992; Hill 1982; Reid 1988:91). British vice consul Archer mentioned in his trade report of 1894 that \"women's cloths of coarse cotton, woven by the Laos [were] sought after in Burma as being very durable,\" although he added that the export was not very considerable (1895). Such cloth, together with silk goods, could also have been offered as tribute to other kingdoms. However they used it, lords - because they could exact tribute and slave labor - found it much easier to acquire cloth than did commoners, who had to weave fabric themselves or find some other means of acquiring it.\nArchival sources also indicate that royal slaves were involved in silk weaving. The British official A. H. Hildebrand noted, \"There is a good deal of trade capable of being done also in silk garments and silk fancy work, at which the slaves and others are great adepts\" (1875). It is not clear whether these slaves lived solely at the court or also in slave settlements established to produce cloth for the court. Silk weaving is known to have been done in only two areas outside the court itself: the towns of San Kamphaeng and Hot (and their immediate environs). While silk weaving continues to this day in San Kamphaeng, in Hot only traces survive in archival sources and in the memories of the town's oldest residents. No information survives to explain why Hot, a town some 70 kilometers from Chiang Mai, would have been a center of silk production and weaving, or why the industry died out. (Villagers said it was because the cocoons scared easily and so had died.) However, in San Kamphaeng a senior member of one of the prestigious silk-weaving families recounted the local version of the history of silk weaving in his area. According to his account, lords victorious in war would capture various kinds of artisans and resettle them in their own kingdoms. Thus, silversmiths were settled near the south end of Chiang Mai town, lacquer ware artists in another location, and weavers in San Kamphaeng. This account indeed suggests that the silk weavers in San Kamphaeng may have been royal slaves weaving at the behest of the court.\nSome idea of the potential scale of royal weaving was given by D. J. Edwardes, who wrote that the ruling lord of Chiang Mai had 300 slaves weaving cloth for him (1875). It appears that these Chiang Mai silks were marketed in Burma. In his summary of the Chiang Mai kingdom, Lowndes commented: \"Weaving and embroidery are the principal handicrafts, the silk putsoes [phaa nung] are much sought after by the Burmans, as they wear three times as long as those of Burmese manufacture\" (1871). He made a similar point about the silk woven in Hot, noting that it was \"said to be very strong and durable\" and adding, \"A thitgoung [headman] showed me a putso that he had had in wear for 7 years, and it was by no means worn out\" (1871).\nIn San Kamphaeng, where silk production has continued to the present day, raw silk was imported from Luang Prabang, Laos, and later from Mandalay, Burma. Raw silk was also routinely imported by the Haw traders coming from Yunnan, China (Hill 1982; see also Bowie 1992).\nThe geographical distribution of raw materials had social implications. Since sufficient quantities of cotton grew in upland regions of northern Thailand to be readily exported, cotton was more accessible to ordinary villagers and could, in turn, be extracted by the ruling lords through tribute. Since silkworms were not abundant in northern Thailand, raw silk had to be imported. Silk's scarcity heightened its price and its prestige value, serving to concentrate silk weaving in the hands of the court. Aristocratic control of silk production was further aided by the fact that the silk fiber is very fine and hence is far more difficult and time-consuming to weave than cotton.\nA comparison of cotton and silk production, then, reveals important contrasts. While cotton was exported, silk was imported into northern Thailand. While cotton was generally woven by freeholding villagers, silk seems to have been woven by slaves and members of the aristocracy. While villagers, except those who begged or stole their clothing, had to obtain textiles through direct economic means, aristocrats were able to augment their own production through the political means of tribute and slave labor. Furthermore, because poverty was widespread and not all villagers grew or wove cotton themselves, many villagers faced hardships in acquiring clothing of any kind for their families.\nUnderstanding the process of textile production helps contemporary readers gain insight into the cultural meaning of cloth to 19th century northern Thai. Once we understand the chronic poverty of most villagers and the difficulty with which villagers obtained even the simplest of cotton cloth, the significance of cloth in daily life and in village rituals becomes clearer. Simultaneously, we can begin to enter the cultural world of 19th century villagers to learn the social meaning of the difference between clothes made of cotton and those made of silk.\nUnderstanding the productive process also helps us appreciate the manner in which textiles were interwoven with royal authority. Because of their coercive power, the lords were able to exact cloth as tribute from freeholders and labor from slaves. Their political position reinforced their economic position, since the textiles - and other goods - they acquired through tribute and slave labor were apparently marketed for revenue. The revenue and surplus textiles they acquired through the labor of others, in turn, reinforced their political position. By sponsoring large, conspicuous merit-making ceremonies in which they gave robes and pillows to monks, the lords enhanced their prestige and, ironically, created an image of generosity. The fine silks in which the lords dressed themselves symbolized not only their distinction from the poor but also their own relationship to the political economy of the kingdom.\nCombining oral histories with archival sources, this article has examined textile consumption and production in 19th century northern Thailand. If we have an understanding of the social process of textile production, the \"concentrated meaning\" (Barthes 1984:185) of northern Thailand textiles becomes more apprehensible. Such apparently minor details of fashion as the use of a silk skirt border - or, as one early observer phrases it, \"a showy strip of wrought silk\" - can no longer be interpreted as meaning that \"rich and poor all dress[ed] alike\" (Cort 1886:346). Important differences in dress, household possessions, and ritual prestations separated the aristocracy from the peasantry. These differences signified profound differences in the relationship of each to the political economy. Thus, the semiotics of consumption in northern Thai society is illuminated by an understanding of its political economy. This article on the consumption and production of textiles in 19th century northern Thailand has been at once a description of the social context of textiles and an exercise in historical anthropology. The evaluation and appropriate application of archival sources present a challenge to every historical anthropologist, since these sources are replete with omissions and distortions. However, by interweaving oral histories with archival sources, we can recapture much of the fabric of the past. Oral histories enhance the archival sources by contributing some sense of the lived experiences of the unrecorded majority. This article has shown how developing a better understanding of a society's political economy can provide an independent means to assess the opinions of outside observers of indigenous societies.\nAcknowledgments. This article emerges from my dissertation fieldwork on 19th century political economy, conducted from 1984 to 1986 under the auspices of the National Research Council of Thailand with a grant from the Social Science Research Council. Subsequent fieldwork specifically on textile production was conducted during the summer of 1989 with a grant from the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I would like to thank Cornelia Kammerer, Jean De Bernardi, Nicola Tannenbaum, Patricia Cheesman, Songsak Prangwatthanakun, Kristine Hastreiter, Kate Bjork, Hugh Wilson, and the American Ethnologist reviewers for their various contributions toward the research and writing of this article.\n1 Edwardes' summary raises questions about Anthony Reid's conclusion that in Southeast Asia, \"the difference in dress between rich and poor, servant and master, king and commoner, was less marked than in pre-industrial Europe, where each man's station and even vocation could be read in the prescribed style of dress\" (1988:85).\n2 The distinctions of dress appear to have been quite subtle at times. Crawfurd wrote, \"The better classes permit the ends of the dress to hang loosely in front, but the lower orders tuck them under the body, securing them behind\" (1987:313).\nAlthough the older men in northern Thai villages sport tattoos, the practice has fallen out of vogue among the current generation of northerners. For more on the symbolism of tattoos, see Nicola Tannenbaum (1987).\n4 In the course of my interviewing I also encountered villagers who made mention of sumptuary rules with regard to housing and clothing, but they were unable to recall any of the specifics. The quotation cited suggests not only that sumptuary laws existed but also that they varied by ruler and kingdom.\n5 During dissertation fieldwork in 1984-86, I interviewed more than 500 villagers over the age of 80 living in about 400 villages throughout the Chiang Mai Valley. I repeatedly asked villagers for their recollections of life when they were young as well as for their memories of what their parents and grandparents had said about life in their days (see Bowie 1988). This article emerges from accidental observations made during my dissertation research. During the summer of 1989 I interviewed another 100 villagers, specifically asking about textiles.\n6 Considerable confusion is caused by the various linguistic borrowings of the 19th century English language sources, which alternately use Indian, Burmese, and central Thai words to describe northern Thai clothing. Thus, terms such as phaa nung, lungi, and putso are used in ambiguous ways. In general, these terms refer to the lengths of cloth worn by both men and women on the lower half of the body. The lengths may be sewn into a tube (as in the phaa sin) or twisted into a thick cord worn between the legs (as in the phaa toi). To add to the confusion, the usage of these terms has changed over time. During the 19th century, phaa nung referred to the length of cloth worn on the lower part of the body by central Thai men and women alike, corresponding most closely to the phaa toi worn by northern Thai men. Over time the meaning has changed to refer to the tubular cloth, or phaa sin, worn during the 19th century by northern Thai women and now worn by women throughout the country.\n8 Bock, writing in 1884, observed, \"A few Lao women are beginning to wear tight-fitting jackets, cut to the shape of the figure, with equally tight sleeves, something after the style of the 'ladies' jerseys' recently so fashionable in Paris and London, and involving no small amount of labour to get on and off\" (1986 :327). Writing at about the same time, Cort made a similar observation: \"Some are beginning to wear jackets or waists, but the usual style is for the women to have a brightly colored cotton or silk scarf tied around their chests just under the arms\" (1886:348).\n9 The indigo-dyed cotton daew chador and indigo shirts now identified as stereotypical of the Thai peasantry appear to have been of recent vintage, dating from about the turn of the century. Ironically, the blue farmer shirts (sya moh hoom) now worn by university students and Thai officials to demonstrate Thai nationalist pride seem to have been popularized by Chinese merchants. The daew chador has more in common with Chinese-style loose-fitting pants than with the traditional phaa toi. Additional support for the view that jackets became more common as the century progressed are provided in a few passing comments. In 1868 Henry Alabaster detailed his recollections of people's dress ten years earlier, noting: \"I remember that ten years ago at any of the great festivals which attracted there 40 or 50,000 spectators, almost all wore but one garment - or a sarong and scarf. Now almost every one adds thereto a cotton or silk jacket\" (1868). Stringer, writing in his trade report of 1890 specifically about northern Thailand, commented, \"The wearing of singlets and coats of European pattern by the men and cotton jackets by the women is becoming more common\" (1891).\n10 That cloth was highly valued elsewhere in Southeast Asia is also reflected in the following Burmese proverb: \"If you are on the way to an ahlu [merit-making ceremony], do not wear your jacket; carry it and put it on when you arrive; it lasts longer that way\" (Nash 1965:232).\n11 \"A comment on the poverty of temple slaves in Burma supplies further evidence that the sheer amount of cloth in one's clothing was an indication of economic status: \"They are poor these slaves, the men wear no brilliant putsoes and the women wear no vest beneath their jacket\" (Rangoon Gazette Weekly Budget 1899b).\n12 The value of cloth is also suggested in a northern Thai rhyme describing the payment that three women received in return for sexual favors: \"Miss Kum asked for silver, Miss Huan asked for cloth, Miss Noja asked for an elephant. Hurry up and finish Doctor\" (Bristowe 1976:127, cited in Patel 1990:127). Cotton's value as a commodity is seen too in the fact that there were traveling minstrels who literally \"sang for their cotton.\" A favorite form of village entertainment in the past was soh, witty and often bawdy repartee between a male and a female singer, with musical accompaniment. One especially popular form of soh was the soh kep nok, or \"singing repartee to collect birds.\" In villages with surplus raw cotton, this soh would be performed as soh laek fai (singing in exchange for cotton). Each village household wishing a performance would build a tree as a stage prop, with cotton representing the birds in the tree. At a certain point in the plot, the male singer would then \"shoot down\" all the cotton birds and put them in his bag. Having collected all the cotton balls, the performers would then move to the next house where they had been invited to perform, again receiving cotton as payment. (For more on the soh kep nok performance itself, see Shim- bhanao 1982-84).\n13 Nineteenth-century paintings have been preserved at Wat Phumin in Nan and Wat Phra Singh in Chiang Mai.\n14 Because during times of peace Chiang Tung and Chiang Mai were closely linked by trade as well as by cultural and linguistic similarities, I include these descriptions of Chiang Tung in the discussion of northern Thailand. Kun or Khynn is the name of the ethnic group living in the region around Chiang Tung (Keng Tung), many of whom were brought to Chiang Mai as war captives and resettled there.\n15 Stringer wrote that Manchester chowls, \"of which four different sizes are sold, fetch from Rs. 20 to Rs. 24 per corge of 20 pieces, and the Bombay goods, also sold in four sizes, fetch from Rs. 17 to Rs. 20 per corge\" (1891). Chowl is another word for phaa nung. According to T. Carlisle's 1899 trade report, chowl was \"the Indian name for the Siamese 'phalai' or 'paley,' that is the 'phaanung' or lower portion of the Siamese costume printed and furnished with a glaze\" (1900). In other words, it was a length of printed cloth some three to four meters long. A possibly higher figure for the price per length was given by Alabaster, who suggested that if the British could manufacture sarongs to sell retail at about 4 to 6 shillings apiece, they might find a market in Thailand (1868). Since the rupee was valued at 13 pence in 1895, this would suggest a cost of 3.7 to 5.6 rupees per length. However, I have no figures with which to calculate the shilling/rupee exchange rate for 1868.\n16 James Ingram has done a remarkable job of gathering wage labor rates for central Thailand (1964).\n17 1t is interesting that while remarking on the indolence of the natives, Black commented that it was \"not uncommon to find Khamoos working for foresters who had failed to pay their wages for 5-6 years\" (1900).\n18 Until the early part of the 20th century, the Burmese rupee (called the taep in northern Thai) was the dominant currency in northern Thailand. The Siamese (central Thai) baht only became the standard currency thereafter. The baht equaled 100 satang. The exchange rate between the Siamese baht and the Burmese rupee fluctuated but was about 80 to 90 satang per rupee (according to interviews and Archer 1895). Since a win equaled 12 satang, it was approximately equivalent to one-seventh of a rupee.\n19 The significance of sumptuary laws is ambiguous. On the one hand, the presence of such laws suggests an elite strong enough to have them passed; on the other hand, it also suggests an elite whose status is being undermined. It has been argued that in England, where a variety of such laws were passed, they represented not the strength of the aristocracy but its weakness vis-\u00e0-vis the growing fiscal strength of the bourgeoisie. Sumptuary laws have even been interpreted as the protectionist tactics of a local bourgeoisie protecting domestic production against foreign imports (see Hooper 1915). They have also been interpreted as paternalistic efforts by concerned governments to protect their citizens from profligacy (Phillips and Staley 1961).\n21 Far more remains to be said about the raw materials needed for dyeing. For more on this and other dyes, see Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman (1987) and Fraser-Lu (1988). See Schneider (1976) for a fascinating discussion of the importance of dyes in the political economy of Europe.\n22 A few of the traditional ordination pillows have survived. I saw one that was among a villager's last remaining unsold treasures; it had been made by his mother for his initiation. A triangular pillow made of black satin cloth, it had gold thread embroidered into a flower design at the points of the triangle.\n23 Cloth that has been worn as a woman's phaa sin can be very powerful symbolically. Soldiers often wore pieces from their mothers' phaa sins to protect them in battle, with the idea that their mothers had done the most to give them life and would do the most to protect them. This symbolism becomes even more intriguing when considered in light of the famous myth of Queen Chamathevi. She wove pieces of a phaa sin into a hat for a suitor to ensure that his arrows would fall short of their mark and he would thus fail in his quest for her hand in marriage. The stratagem worked.\n24 Textile production seems to have been a more important and more widespread part of the village household economy in northeastern than in northern Thailand. Consequently, I believe, cloth goods figured more prominently in wedding celebrations in the northeast.\n26 The Pali word kathina means a piece of cloth that in former times was donated to a temple for making robes; alternatively, it means the wooden frame on which the cloth was traditionally sewn into robes (Davis 1984:200).\n27 Even today kathin ceremonies are \"most often sponsored by government agencies, private companies, and wealthy families\" (Davis 1984:200).\n28 The central Thai king, King Mongkut, wore robes of yellow silk while he was a monk (Feltus 1924:53).\nRich people didn't know how to spin or weave. They bought their clothes ready-made or hired other people to weave their cloth for them. Rich people were too lazy to weave for themselves. But some rich people were stingy; they wove their own clothes instead of hiring poor people.\n30 lronically, Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman suggest that in the past \"every woman owned at least one tin chok for special occasions\" (1987:12). Because these borders required so much skill to weave and were so expensive to buy, I am quite skeptical of this claim. I think that only the wealthiest of villagers, or villagers who were themselves expert weavers, would have owned a tin jok.\n31 Hildebrand did not specify how the slaves of the second chief were employed; however, we know from Bock's account that one of the second chief's wives had her slaves spin silk. Hildebrand wrote, \"The second chief's source of income is not so calculable; he derives a good deal from the labor of his slaves, of whom, with his wives and children, he never has less than 600 under his roof, and the number outside would probably double this amount\" (1875).\n1868 Trade Report of Siam of 1867.

{"sample_id": 4656, "text": "What a difference a day makes in the mountains. Yesterday we awoke to snow and got a couple of inches before the temperature got above freezing and the ground snow melted while it was still snowing and blowing horizontally. I think it got up to about 40\u00baf yesterday and dropped to 22\u00baf last night. I fear there will be no fruit in our orchard this year. Unfortunately, all 5 apple trees, both peaches and both Asian pears were already blooming. The garden seems to have survived and the chickens didn\u2019t even notice.\nToday is bright and sunny, the wind has calmed and it is 62\u00baf. Much too nice a day to stay inside, yet too iffy, especially at night to do any garden work, so I tied on the sneakers, grabbed my trekking poles and hiked away from the house while the kids were having quiet time and Jim was sitting in the loft, still recovering from another bout of bronchitis. I decided to take a hike that I had not previously taken, down the gravel road, took a right and hiked up the cow paths to a ridge we see from the paved road when we go up the mountain. The views from there were fabulous.\nA shot east and the steeple of the church half way up to our house. A shot west up the valley. And a shot south toward the highway we can hear trucks on, but not see from our house, to a house that has been built in the hollow over the ridge. I got my 10,000+ steps, climbed the equivalent of 77 flights of steps, enjoyed the bright sunny day for well over an hour and a half. The fresh spring air was delightful.\nWhile hiking along the cow paths, I spotted many tiny violets blooming in the woods.\nAfter coming back down from the ridge and crossing the road, I climbed the hill above our house and walked back around that hill and returned to the road and the walk home.\nSoon those cow pastures between the woods will be too tall to walk and I will have to stick to the woods and roads.\nTomorrow is another beautiful day and after a late morning appointment, I plan to try another trail that I have never hiked before it gets too overgrown as well.\nThis month is flying and so much yet to do. We still don\u2019t have a tree. Maybe next week. As I was going to bed down the chooks last evening, and to collect 5 very cold eggs, I was being gently pelted by small frozen pellets. Our table sits in front of the French doors to the back deck and we watched during dinner as the stained wood was coated and turned white. We weren\u2019t really expecting much in the way of bad weather last night, the Nor\u2019easter that was pounding up the coast to New England wasn\u2019t going to hit Virginia too hard and we were catching only the westerly edge of wind and moisture, chilled by our winter temperatures. Awakening this morning with it still heavily overcast, the cedars, pines, and other firs looked like they had been sugar coated.\nAll fog and frosting and totally enchanting. After feeding pups and me breakfast, it was chicken chore time and on my way back from giving them their morning portion of grains and kitchen scraps, a glance in the same general direction showed a beautiful mountain phenomenon.\nThe clouds breaking up but clinging to the hollows in the mountains, producing a floating ridge. The sun will quickly melt the frosting on the trees, but it made for a beautiful holiday scene.\nLast night I knitted until my hands were cramped, but met my yesterday\u2019s goal of getting the body of grandson\u2019s sweater finished. Today\u2019s goal is the hood and a desperately needed bath. It has picked up dog hair and dust as it has been lugged around the house and in the car in an effort to get it completed.\nThe hood is a simple 9\u2033 long stockinette rectangle the width of the neckline plus a few stitches. It should be done in a couple of hours then stitching up the seam to close the rectangle into a hood, stitch up the underarms and a quick wash.\nThe missing gift that is in the mail was near here according to tracking, perhaps to arrive today, so the box of Christmas that must be mailed away should be ready by tomorrow.\nBack to the knitting goal. Must get on it.\nWow, a gorgeous day and not to be wasted indoors. Jim wanted a roadtrip to buy a riding jacket that is more appropriate for the warm days. His vintage look leather jacket is fine with the vents open up to about 70\u00baf but he came home last Sunday and I thought he was going to pass out. He had struggled with the bike on our gravel road and driveway and basically walked it downhill the .4 miles and was so overheated it was dangerous. To make our trip, we checked out various rides he could do or had done that keep him off of the Interstate which is so heavy with semi trucks that it is dangerous. Between the driving and the shopping we were gone for nearly 5 hours and I saw some beautiful countryside that I had never seen before.\nMy mother grew up in this part of the country and I often heard stories about the counties and towns, but had never seen them. I had my camera, but didn\u2019t think to take a single photo. Near the last part of the drive, we rode for 45 miles along a beautiful creek lined with cabins and homes.\nWhen we got home, I went over to check on the chickens, collect eggs, and give them a treat of wild mustard greens and discovered an empty coop.\nFor the past several evenings, there have been 3 or 4 of the chicks out at dusk, but the rest remained steadfastly indoors. Today they are all outside, merrily pecking at the grass or dust bathing in the shade.\nThe littles totally being ignored by the adults, much to my delight. They still segregate at night and so I am leaving the partition in place for a few more days. We are due for a couple of days of rain, so there may be more in coop time, especially for them. On Friday, they will be 9 weeks old and I think the partition will come down. I\u2019m still at a quandry about Cogburn. I really want a self sustaining flock, but since he only has 3 hens in with him now, he is wearing them out and their backs have almost no feathers on them. They make \u201csaddles\u201d to protect them, but I don\u2019t want to go that route. If I remove him, there won\u2019t be any coop chicks unless I am able to quickly get some Buff Orpington fertilized eggs quickly when a hen goes broody. I really don\u2019t want to do the heat lamp brooder bit again, though I know that I will have to for the meat chickens. Maybe I should just accept that is the way it will be every few years as we replace the older hens. If we had electricity out there that would run the heat lamp, I would just build a brooder coop with separate run, but we don\u2019t.\nAt least, this time, I have successfully raised and introduced 10 chicks to the mix with no fatalities.\nThe snow pack is thinning. Our neighbor that hays our fields for the bulk of the hay came down after dark Saturday night with his behemoth tractor with climate control cab and plowed out our driveway. As he was the one who constructed it for us a couple of summers ago, he knows generally where it is under the snow. This allowed us to bring both vehicles back down to the house. To change things up a bit, this morning we drove into the university town to a little local diner for breakfast. The nearest parking is across Main Street and slightly uphill and though the access was cleared, the parking spaces have been trod by many feet in the past half week and between each parking space is an ice slick. Both of us had slides, fortunately with no fall just trying to get out of the car and to the cleared walkway.\nYesterday as the roads seem to be mostly cleared, we took a jaunt 2000 more feet up our mountain to see more snow.\nIf you ever watched \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d this is the \u201clodge\u201d in the movie, also know as Mountain Lake Lodge, a hotel with adjacent cabins. Though it is closed this time of year, except for special weekend events, it is still beautiful.\nThe elevation there is about 4400 feet and the ridge has trees frosted generally from frozen fog that forms.\nThe property on the near edge of this valley belonged to my grandfather\u2019s family, though when we bought our farm, I had no idea that it was literally walking distance away. My hubby teases that I did know, but I had never even been to this county or seen that area at the time.\nAs we were going up to see the lake and the hotel in the snow, we saw this. It is not our car, there was no one in it, but this is a lesson on why you don\u2019t drive a 2 wheel drive vehicle on snowy, icy mountain roads. The only thing keeping this car from tumbling on down the mountain side is the tree behind it that it hit as it slid over the embankment. Hopefully, no one was hurt. It will take a thaw and a creative, daredevil tow truck driver to get that one out.\nThat is the mountain on which the red car, the hotel, and our home are located.\nFortunately, this snow did not take out our power, so all of the prep we did for it does not have to be done again for the ice storm due tonight that more than likely will steal all of the conveniences from us for at least a day or two."}

I've been listening to podcasts and reading tons of articles about this topic, and I am even more passionate than ever about spreading this message to the masses. Food has the power to alter your moods, your energy, and remedy your ailments, aches, pains, illnesses, and more. And yes, this can feel a bit scary. But it is also incredibly empowering.\nI have been eating clean for 4 years now, and carb cycling for the past 5 weeks. Having a solid foundation of \"clean eating\" was very helpful for moving into carb cycling. It is a simple strategy to implement, but it requires REALLY cleaning up your diet for at least 6 days a week. The carbs you eat are complex carbs like rice, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, and quinoa. No bread and no pasta. And no refined sugar. Working through this program has really allowed me to become in touch with my body and what it needs, how it responds to food, and what works best to keep me functioning at my best. I'm incredibly aware of how everything I am eating affects me, and it's thrilling!\nWhen I was in my 20's, I always had an upset stomach. At least once a day, every day, my stomach hurt. And I legit just thought it was part of being alive. Some foods just hurt when they digest. Now that I have cleaned up my diet, if I have an upset stomach, I can pinpoint what caused it and when it started. And then I can correct it. That was a result of eating clean. But let's take it a step further. NOW that I am carb cycling, I can tell you exactly what foods give me the best energy, sleep, and feel-good feeling. It's amazing!\nEveryone deserves to feel their best. I want to help as many people as I can find that power that is within them to transform their health and their lives. If you are ready for my help, I will be leading another group of participants through my Carb Cycling 101 program. Will be begin on May 8th. Click here to register!"}

The technology has yet to be deployed commercially, but the unparalleled predictability of the movement and intensity of tides suggests it has clear advantages for the power industry, versus some of the other renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.\nAccording to an Atlantis press release, ocean power, which includes tidal current power, wave power and ocean thermal energy conversion, represents a vast source of energy estimated at between 2,000 and 4,000 terawatt hours per year. The US and the UK combined have sufficient ocean power potential to meet around 15% of their power needs.\nHaving spent 10 years developing its turbines, Cornelius says Atlantis is now ready to become the first tidal power developer to establish mini-arrays (essentially farms or fields of multiple subsea turbines of 1 or 2 megawatts each). This will allow it to aggregate the necessary data about environmental and turbine performance before it moves on to apply for permits for projects of a much more significant scale.\nThese commercial projects should see the company turn cash flow positive in 2011, he adds.\nThe company has had a 150KW turbine installed and connected to the grid in Australia since 2006 and is hoping to build up its generation capacity there, but it is also actively looking for several other sites both in Asia and Europe where it can set up trail arrays. It is currently evaluating potential installation opportunities in the Pentland Firth off Northern Scotland, in the Bay of Fundy and in British Columbia off the east and west costs of North America and off the coast of South Korea.\nChina also has the potential to become a \u201chuge\u201d market, according to Cornelius, since the company\u2019s Nereus turbine that is suitable for shallow-water can be deployed not just in tidal oceans, but in rivers too \u2013 and that is a resource that China has a plenty of. Atlantis also has a second type of turbine, the Solon, which is a deep-water turbine that can be installed in some of the fastest flowing currents in the world."}

The soaring economies of China, India, Russia, Brazil and other emerging nations increasingly are setting the pace, overshadowing the slower growth of the United States, Europe and Japan, where the benefits of the expansion have eluded many workers.\n\"This is the first recovery where developing economies are playing a dominant role,\" said James Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, which manages money for big investors such as pension funds.\nThe trend is being driven by free trade, which has created millions of jobs in emerging nations in recent years, fueling stunning new wealth in those countries.\nThis is a story not only at odds with the facts--strong US GDP growth and low unemployment--but with itself--the jobs in those developing countries consist of doing the manufacturing and other work [answering phones] we're too wealthy to do ourselves. It does though demonstrate just how powerful the End of History remains -- forcing capitalism upon such a wide array of nations -- even at a time when folks want to dismiss it.\nAmerica and China have been serving as twin engines of the global economy, helping to fuel worldwide growth of 4 percent or higher for several years straight.\nOur late editor Bob Bartley used to say that critics might forgive you for being wrong, but they'll never forgive you for being right. That psychological insight may be the only way to explain the fierce and bitter opposition this week to extending the tax cuts of 2003 for another two years through 2010.\nIf ever there was a market test of economic policy, the last three years have been it. The stock market has recovered from its implosion in Bill Clinton's last year in office, unemployment is down to 4.7%, and growth has averaged 3.9% in the three years since those tax cuts passed--well above the post-World War II average and more than twice the growth rate in Euroland.\nRealistically, the United States should be counted with the emerging economies, not the European.\n\"The soaring economies of China, India, Russia, Brazil and other emerging nations increasingly are setting the pace, overshadowing the slower growth of the United States, Europe and Japan...\"\nAnd with the utterly inane comparison of the \"slow growth\" of the US with Europe & Japan, it is officially OK to stop reading, as the writer has proven he doesn't know a thing about economics."}

The \u2019Noles who turned out for the event participated in a series of strength and conditioning drills before splitting up to perform various exercises specific to their position, all with NFL scouts and coaches analyzing their mechanics and motions.\nFor some, FSU\u2019s Pro Day was little more than a formality, as was the case for defensive end Brian Burns. Currently projected to be taken in the first round of this year\u2019s NFL Draft, Burns\u2019 impressive performance at the NFL Combine left little for him to prove heading into the day\u2019s events.\nAs such, the six-foot-five defensive end opted to focus mainly on position drills, allowing NFL scouts to assess his mobility and ability to change direction in space. With the draft less than a month away, Burns has been in contact with the Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans.\nFollowing his drills, Burns spoke about how well both he and his teammates performed on the day as they prepare for the NFL Draft.\nFor other players, such as defensive tackle Demarcus Christmas and wide receiver Nyqwan Murray, Pro Day was a chance to brush up on and perform better in drills that each struggled with at the NFL Combine.\nHoping to perform better without all of the uncomfortable spotlight of the Combine, Christmas was satisfied with his Pro Day performance in a facility that former Seminoles like himself had previously practiced in and were familiar with.\nChristmas\u2019 improvement on the 40-yard dash from a 5.08 at the NFL Combine to a 4.90 on Thursday solidified a successful outcome for him.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t smooth sailing for Murray unfortunately, as he pulled up during a position-specific catching drill clutching his hamstring and mouthing, \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d to assembled onlookers.\nThe wide receiver\u2019s Pro Day performance was certainly limited by his recent injury, as he was unable to run the 40-yard dash due to the pain. Murray also felt he could have done better running routes in position drills if it weren\u2019t for his injured leg.\nOn the other hand, defensive back A.J. Westbrook certainly made the most of his Pro Day, as he rode a fast start to an overall strong performance, literally.\nIn the 40-yard dash, which was the first event of the day, the Daytona Beach, Florida native made scouts do a double take as he posted a 4.40 finish. Westbrook then translated that success to his positional drills, keeping the scouts\u2019 eyes on him despite the fact that several NFL personnel in attendance were likely there to see other players first.\nIn any case, Thursday\u2019s Pro Day officially sealed the college careers of this year\u2019s Florida State draft class. The Garnet & Gold will once again be well represented in the draft, with Burns projected to be a first-round pick, Christmas expected to be selected between the third and fifth rounds, and a slew of Seminoles likely to be taken after the fifth round.\nMarch 24, 2019, 3:12 p.m.\nMarch 31, 2019, 5:18 p.m."}

{"sample_id": 9394, "text": "We all strive to be better people and to embody what most of us call excellence. But there\u2019s a fairly large gap between excellence and what we might call innovation. Both qualities live on the leading edge. Excellence surpasses what might be considered required or average performance where innovation takes our actions into expanding beyond the envelope of what is expected in terms of perspective and options. In accomplishing either there\u2019s also a tremendous difference in the rapport we can expect to have with others, especially our peer group, relative to the support we might also expect to come from them. Being on the leading edge can be extremely exciting but at the same time disconcertingly lonely.\nPortraying excellence sometimes embodies a few unexpected twists but it, invariably and generally, matches some \u201cjob description\u201d or intended and publicly assumed goal. With whatever is accomplished there remains a sense of consistency and the feeling that things will go on as they are and that we are all on the \u201cright path.\u201d Humans love consistency. It provides a reassuring and solid point of reference for us to know that we stand within the specified limits of what is possible for the average person and what will be acceptable by our society\u2019s majority for our approval, continued support and our guaranteed sense of belonging. In this we remain part of the herd and will keep receiving their shelter and protection. Innovation moves way past excellence in what is expected, however. It does have its perks in connecting us with like minded individuals who usually, end up becoming our support system. But even there, jealousy and resentment can rear its ugly head but, perhaps, not quite as much as simply excelling past our limits.\nThis regard for excellence and hero worship has spawned many proverbs and myths about socially desired perspectives designed to promote success but within specified social parameters protecting the status quo so everyone may feel safe and secure within accepted guidelines. \u201cEverybody loves a winner\u201d is one of our proliferated social proverbs. On the surface it requires our expected, and usually granted, public adulation of the winner but underneath it sparks cloaked jealousy and resentment within \u201caverage\u201d people. Why?\nWithin our contemporary social context we have a spoken, unspoken and often accepted assumption that to be considered \u201cgood\u201d and productive by others we must always strive to do our best and even more so when life and its circumstances challenge our survival and our comfort. But living life with life\u2019s challenges can often be overwhelming and draining of whatever energy we have well past our capacity to regenerate it and resume our struggle. In light of this perceived \u201cbattering\u201d we often assess our resiliency as not being \u201cup to snuff\u2019 with what we think others expect us to cope with. This tends to lead us to feel \u201cbadly\u201d about ourselves and to either hide our perceived inadequacies or, if they are too obvious, rationalize them away. We may also find refuge with others through commiseration. Generally, if we don\u2019t commiserate we just accept \u201cdiscommendation,\u201d pull back and refocus elsewhere. This is not a self-empowering feeling when we live in what we might perceive as a highly competitive society. However, we usually just do our best to put I out of our minds.\nWhen someone exhibits excellence in something we have struggled with and have not been able to overcome, it resurfaces our feelings of frustration, overwhelming and defeat. Depending on our level of maturity, strength of self-confidence and if the person achieving excellence is \u201cone of our clan\u201d will determine how we react. If the person is \u201cone of our clan\u201d we may have mixed reactions; partly happy for them and the group and partly sad about our own experience with our past efforts. If either or both of our maturity or self-confidence are below the threshold of feeling compassion, we will tend to congratulate them outwardly and resent them privately.\nAchieving excellence puts us in a precarious position with our friends, loved ones and peer group. First, it puts us in a position of leadership whether we want it or not. This, in itself, can put us into circumstances which accelerate resentment and competition among and with those who \u201cfollow\u201d us. Second, it puts us into a position that, were we to repeat the challenge, we would be expected to repeat our excelling performance, at the least, to the degree that would qualify us for continued accolades regardless as to whether the circumstances had remained the same or had become more difficult. Third, if we did not repeat our performance to the level that we gained accolades for on a subsequent challenge, those who \u201cfollowed\u201d us would denigrate us mercilessly. Why? Because we had been reluctantly elevated, to a level of \u201cbetter than,\u201d by them, and was expected to and failed to \u201cspearhead\u201d as a \u201cpoint man\u201d the task that no one else could or would do leaving a vacuum that someone else will have to fill and, potentially, fail at revealing their perceived inadequacies.\nIn no way am I attempting to discourage anyone from attempting and achieving excellence and innovation. However, it is necessary to become aware that the support system or even the commiseration that once came with being part of an \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cregular\u201d group of people may often change from what we expect from them. The security, belonging and acceptance of being just one of the \u201cregular guys\u201d evaporates when we outstrip our peers in performance. Our excelling performance reminds them of what they should or could be doing exposing their self doubts and, if they employ projection, they begin to look at us as a problem diminishing their self-image in the presence of their peers and the world. I actually had a coworker say to me, \u201cDon\u2019t work so fast. You\u2019re making us look bad.\u201d This type of attitude tends to make them distance themselves from us allowing their self-doubts to again retreat into their shadow and then validate their withdrawal by commiserating with the remaining peer group about their differences from us through rationalizing their perceived inadequacies.\nThere is one other perspective that I wish to bring to your attention. And that is the plight of a family member who is used as a \u201ccatch all\u201d for blame when the family is unable to either accomplish something or live up to a standard that\u2019s \u201crequired\u201d for social approval. This is can also be a person who moves onto the leading edge relative to their family\u2019s health and functioning. This family member then becomes the \u201cscapegoat.\u201d Even though they may receive derision for being the cause of perceived but hidden family \u201cincompetence,\u201d they still receive a form of family protection and inclusion through maintaining the dysfunctional family rapport with the perceived family inadequacies by keeping them covered and hidden from public knowledge. When the \u201cscapegoat\u201d moves past his or her role as sustainer of the projected family mask by reclaiming his or her own self-respect and dignity, the family feels intensely threatened and will subject him or her to much more pressure while additionally threatening them with \u201cexcommunication\u201d lest they return to their prior supportive role in keeping the family secrets intact and unexposed. As we can see here also, excellence and innovation are relative to what is expected regardless of the level we start at.\nThere's no Crowd on the Leading Edge. Not only must we deal with the challenge of the circumstances that we strive to overcome to be an excellent or innovative performer, but we must also deal with potential feelings of jealousy and resentment coming from our immature co-workers or family members who were either unable or unwilling to achieve excellence on their own. Our fate is often in becoming the object of gossip and, perhaps, being ostracized. Being on the leading edge can truly be exciting AND a lonely place. It often requires us to make a choice between remaining as a safe and secure sheep among the \u201caverage\u201d in the herd or moving past our limits to accomplish what others may only dream of. All of us must eventually choose."}

{"sample_id": 1546, "text": "Psoriasis, a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin disorder. The most common type, called plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), is characterized by slightly elevated reddish patches or papules (solid elevations) covered with silvery white scales. In most cases, the lesions tend to be symmetrically distributed on the elbows and knees, scalp, chest, and buttocks. The lesions may remain small and solitary or coalesce into large plaques that often form geometrical patterns with a central area of normal skin. In many cases the nails become thickened, irregularly laminated, and brittle. In addition to plaque psoriasis, there are four other types of psoriasis, including guttate, pustular, inverse (or flexular), and erythrodermic.\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated (or autoimmune) disorder that occurs when immune cells known as T lymphocytes, or T cells, attack healthy skin cells in both the nonvascular horny outer layer of the skin and its deeper vascular layer. This attack causes the life span of the skin cells to shorten to about 3 to 5 days (skin cells normally live about 20 to 28 days) and forces the cells to reproduce more rapidly than normal. Psoriasis occurs in both sexes with equal frequency, being most prevalent between the ages of 10 and 30. It is most often seen in northern climates. An estimated 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population is affected by psoriasis. In contrast, between 0.05 and 0.3 percent of Asians experience the condition. In European countries the incidence of psoriasis is highly variable, affecting anywhere from less than 1 percent to more than 6 percent of populations.\nThe onset of psoriasis is usually gradual but occasionally explosive. Precipitating factors may include injury to the skin, acute infection, and psychological upsets. Ordinarily, the lesions become less severe and sometimes disappear during the summer, possibly owing to the effect of sunlight. The severe complications of psoriasis are extensive sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, with resulting inflammation, and psoriatic arthritis. Generally, however, individuals with psoriasis are in relatively good health. The variability in the progression and severity of the disorder has led researchers to suspect that the underlying causes of psoriasis are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is no permanent cure for psoriasis, but there are a variety of treatments aimed at relieving the associated skin symptoms. Topical treatments for psoriasis come in different forms (e.g., creams and gels) and generally provide relief from inflammation and scaling. Some, such as retinoids (derivatives of vitamin A) and synthetic forms of vitamin D, work by slowing skin cell reproduction, whereas others, such as corticosteroids, coal-tar ointment, and salicylic acid, work by reducing inflammation. Psoriasis can also be treated with phototherapy, in which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light. While phototherapy can be highly effective, it does have side effects, including pain, irregular pigmentation, and scarring. In addition, long-term treatments are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.\nOral medications are available to treat psoriasis but are often used as a last resort, because the drugs that are most effective in treating psoriasis suppress the immune system, making patients susceptible to a multitude of infections and illnesses that can be life-threatening. Oral drugs that are used to reduce inflammation include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. Oral drugs called biologics (because they are made from human or animal proteins) modulate the immune system by attacking immune cells that are working improperly. Several biologics have been approved for psoriasis, including infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), and guselkumab (Tremfya)."}

Founded in 1986, their products are free of ingredients that the Dermalogica thinks cause breakouts like lanolin, SD alcohol, mineral oil, and artificial colors and fragrance. Dermalogica is also recognized as cruelty-free by Leaping Bunny and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). They have also been recognized by the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil for sourcing palm oil in a manner that does not negatively impact local wildlife.\nThe Precleanse (\u00a338.50) promises to melt away excess oil, sunscreen, waterproof makeup, environmental pollutants, and residual products with rice bran and borage seed, kukui, and apricot oils.\nThis is a light runny oil that feels nourishing to the skin. It turns into a milky consistency when mixed with water. It feels viscous making it a joy to massage onto the skin. It easily removes long-wearing and waterproof makeup but needs to be massaged more when used to remove mascaras. I like that this leaves the skin soft and moisturized.\nThe Special Cleansing Gel (\u00a332) is a soap-free cleanser that aims to remove impurities without disturbing the skin\u2019s natural moisture balance using quillaja saponaria, balm mint, and lavender extract. This cleanser is lightweight and feels really gentle on the skin. It\u2019s runny and lathers into a comfortable texture great for massaging on the skin. It removes excess oil without leaving my skin stripped or tight.\nThe Daily Microfoliant (\u00a349.50) is a rice-based powder that works to brighten and smooth the skin with papain, salicylic acid, rice enzymes, phytic acid, white tea, licorice, colloidal oatmeal, and allantoin. It contains microbeads but feels gentle on the skin. It lathers easily and doesn\u2019t feel irritating. I usually steer clear of harsh-looking scrubs but this just leaves my skin oh so soft and smooth, something I usually only experience after applying an essence. I like that this is so easy to use, much like a third cleanser, so it doesn\u2019t take too much of my time but still gives me a bright and soft complexion. It has honestly become a favorite.\nThe Skin Smoothing Cream (\u00a357) has the Active HydraMesh Technology\u2122, which is designed to infuse the skin with 48 hours of continuous hydration and help protect it against environmental stress. It is also formulated with hyaluronic acid complex, mallow, cucumber, arnica, grape seed extract, vitamin c, and vitamin e to lock in moisture and protect the skin. A little goes a long way with this one. Five pea-sized dots can cover my whole face. It has a whipped cream-like texture and feels like it liquifies once it\u2019s massaged into the skin. It has a slight cooling effect and its creamy texture takes a few seconds to completely dry. Using this alone in the morning is not enough to hydrate my skin, especially my t zone area so this works best for me as a night moisturizer. It acts as a seal to the products I used before it and leaves my skin smooth and soft without the tackiness. It\u2019s also pillow stain-proof.\nThe Skinperfect Primer SPF30 (\u00a344.50) claims to smooth fine lines, even out texture, protect, and brighten the skin with soy protein, pearl powder, and broad spectrum sunscreen. This tinted primer blurs pores like no other. I have honestly tried a lot of blurring primers but this one did the trick for me. It doesn\u2019t feel silicone-y so it doesn\u2019t give off that pore-blocking feeling. It actually feels a bit oily so I like following this with a mattifying stick. For something so lightweight, I can\u2019t believe that has SPF so this has been an everyday staple for me.\nI have pleasantly enjoyed trying out #dermalogicauk products because even though there are standouts (love the Daily Microfoliant and the Skinperfect Primer SPF30) I enjoyed using these products and will continue to use them."}

{"sample_id": 4646, "text": "Over the years, I have written about various guidance aimed at those working to resolve disputes. This includes RICS\u2019 guidance on how to deal with conflicts of interest and how to be an adjudicator. Two more pieces of guidance have recently been published.\nThis post considers Surveyors acting as expert witnesses (fourth edition), which RICS published in July. Next time I\u2019ll be looking at the latest guidance from the Civil Justice Council, Guidance for the instruction of experts in civil claims 2014, which was published earlier this month. Both take effect this autumn. Judging by some of the recent cases (which Matt is considering), this guidance is essential as the message still isn\u2019t getting through as clearly as many would hope.\nSurveyors acting as expert witnesses is available to RICS members to download from the RICS website and to non-members to buy from www.ricsbooks.com. It has a foreword from Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury and includes sample terms of engagement (in appendix A), as well as an explanation (in appendix B) of an expert\u2019s duty of care following Jones v Kaney, which removed an expert\u2019s general immunity from being sued (changes are also made to GN21 to reflect this lack of immunity).\nIt is made up of a practice statement (PS) and a guidance note (GN). It is mandatory for RICS members to comply with the PS and there may be disciplinary consequences for not doing so. The recommendations in the GN represent \u201cbest practice\u201d, although it is not mandatory for RICS\u2019 members to follow them.\nHe concludes by suggesting that following the guidance will enhance an expert\u2019s credibility and promote confidence in the use of chartered surveyors as experts which, in turn, will promote best practice.\nHigh words of praise indeed, but just what does the guidance say?\nFurther, an expert must not \u201cstray from the duties of an expert witness\u201d and act in a partial, misleading or untruthful manner.\nThe principal message is unchanged from the third edition (which came into effect in January 2009), and sums up the key duties with which experts must comply. A quick glance at the contents list suggests that not much else has changed. However, looks can be deceiving and the devil is in the detail.\nThe section on the application of the PS remains the same from the third edition. The evidence an expert gives to a tribunal, drawing upon his \u201cprofessional experience, knowledge and expertise\u201d is distinct from other evidence that an expert may give, such as evidence of fact or advocacy of a case (PS1.3).\nThe expert\u2019s duties are largely the same and the expert must take \u201cspecial care\u201d to ensure his evidence is not biased towards the party instructing or paying him (PS2.1). Note also that an expert \u201cmust not malign the professional competence of another expert witness (PS2.7).\nActing as an expert (PS3) is also largely unchanged, although it does now expressly state an expert\u2019s appointment cannot take the form of a conditional or success-based arrangement (PS3.6). This reflects changes that were introduced as part of the Jackson reforms. Similar amendments are made in GN19.\nThe section on reports and oral evidence (PS5) has undergone an overhaul, with additional paragraphs reminding an expert to maintain \u201cprofessional objectivity and impartiality at all times\u201d (PS5.2) and to provide \u201cobjective, unbiased opinions\u201d (PS5.3). New wording is also included in the expert\u2019s declaration (PS5.4) to reflect CPR 35.\nIt is one thing for the expert to change his mind, quite another for those instructing him to ask him to change his report. This is dealt with in PS6, with an expanded section highlighting that it is OK for an expert to change his mind after a meeting of experts or the disclosure of new evidence, but not for other reasons (unless the changes \u201caccord\u201d with the expert\u2019s true opinion).\nThe role of the single joint expert (PS8) and the section on advocacy (PS9) have been expanded, but the emphasis in PS9 remains on the distinction between acting as a surveyor-advocate and as an expert, and the issues that arise if the surveyor accepts a dual role.\nA new section on conditional fees has been added (PS10), which confirms an expert witness appointment should not take the form of a conditional or success-based arrangement (although it may be permissible when acting in a dual role (PS10.3)).\nThe section on the application of the GN has been overhauled since the third edition. The GN should be read in conjunction with the PS, providing direction on \u201cgood practice\u201d when an expert is required to give expert evidence before a tribunal. The expert should also comply with any specific rules a tribunal may have (GN1.3). It still emphasises the need for impartiality (GN1.7) and continues to refer to the Ikarian Reefer, although reference to a number of other judgments has gone.\nThe general duties of an expert have been expanded to include acting independently and impartially, to assist the tribunal and to provide a range of opinions, as appropriate (GN2.1).\nGN3 continues to emphasise the distinction between acting as an advisor and acting as an expert, particularly in relation to the potential for disclosure of any initial advice.\nIf an expert cannot fulfill the duties set out in PS2, he should decline the appointment (GN4.1). GN4.2 now refers to resigning as an expert, if these issues arises after appointment.\nThe section on instructions and inspections has also been overhauled (GN5), but the emphasis remains on conflicts of interest and how to deal with them.\nAlthough the purpose of expert evidence no longer has its own section (it was GN6 in the third edition), I\u2019m sure the message about assisting the tribunal is incorporated else where.\nThe section on factual evidence is largely the same (GN6), but opinion evidence (GN7) has been expanded and starts with a helpful reminder of what expert evidence is (opinion based on experience and knowledge).\nGN8 and 9 deal with written questions and documents. Some changes here too, but the overall messages remain the same.\nMore detail is provided on what is expected of an expert when it comes to giving oral evidence (GN 10), not only in terms of preparation but also what form oral evidence takes and how to deal with questions and adjournments.\nConnected to giving evidence is assisting advocates, both before and during any hearing. GN11 provides details of what an expert should expect to do in this regard.\nThere are now two sections on written reports. GN12 addresses the purpose of the report; details of how to set out the report are in GN13. It is worth noting that there are several references in GN12 to the mandatory requirements set out in PS5. Interestingly, it is suggested that if the expert has more than one opinion (because the issues lead to a range of opinions), the expert should articulate these and explain the reasoning behind them (GN13.4(c)).\nThe without prejudice meeting of experts prior to a hearing is an integral part of most litigation and aims to narrow the issues, allowing a tribunal to focus on only those issues that are in dispute. Consequently, the guidance on the meetings of experts (GN14) and narrowing issues (GN15) has been enhanced. It now includes guidance on what to do before, during and after the meeting, including preparing the document reflecting any agreement reached.\nConditional fee arrangements are prohibited and GN 19 has been amended to reflect this. Other issues related to fees are dealt with in GN18 and GN20. One change is to the need to provide an estimate at the outset. The guidance suggests this should only be provided when the expert has a good understanding of the case and the scope of his appointment (GN18.3). However, it is worth noting that the courts\u2019 cost budgeting rules require the parties to exchange budgets prior to the first CMC, which may be much earlier in the process than the expert is comfortable with.\nThe changes seek to reinforce the duties an expert owes to the tribunal, as identified by Lord Neuberger and in the PS\u2019 principal message.\nFollow the requirements of both the PS and GN and you shouldn\u2019t get into the type of bother that some experts have got themselves into.\nMake certain that your expert has complied with the PS and GN, and consider making express reference to this in your instructions. While you might be happy that an expert supports your client\u2019s case wholeheartedly, there\u2019s little point if a tribunal subsequently finds that his or her views are somewhat leftfield.\nPart 2 of this blog, looking at the CJC\u2019s Guidance for the instruction of experts in civil claims 2014, has been published."}
{"sample_id": 4847, "text": "Whether you want to take your mum for lunch or your lover for dinner, Clos Maggiore has that special \u201ctouch of magic\u201d with an added soup\u00e7on of Gallic ooh-la-la. Love is always in the air at this \u201cgloriously romantic\u201d restaurant \u2013 especially if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a table amid the twinkling fairy lights, blossoms and foliage in the glass-roofed conservatory (open to the stars on balmy evenings). Bookings aren\u2019t guaranteed in this inviting space, but you can always settle for one of the less enticing dining areas: either way, expect finely tuned French-accented cooking with some noticeable Mediterranean nuances. \u201cSimply delicious\u201d starters such as hand-picked Dorset crab with anchovy mayonnaise and char-grilled cauliflower or pan-roasted Les Landes duck liver with roasted fig and smoked duck ham open proceedings, ahead of a thumping dish of herb-smoked rack of lamb with goats\u2019 curd and gratinated smoked aubergine for two to share. Vegetarians also fare well, while tricksy desserts feature the signature \u2018caramelised chocolate sensation\u2019 with burnt honey ice cream and Armagnac jelly. Clos Maggiore\u2019s huge (but accessible) wine list also warrants serious exploration.\nWe booked a table for 2 at 1pm. We were ushered upstairs to a pleasant but small room and to a table where my seat was too close to the kitchen door, so plates of food were passing very close to my head as meals were served to other diners. The waitress was quite frosty, from the beginning we had the feeling that she couldn't wait to finish her shift. Rather than let us choose the bread we would like she tossed 3 types of bread on each of our side plates. We didn't want bread as it happens. First course of Dorset crab with anchovy mayonnaise and chargrilled cauliflower, simply delicious as was my guests Sicilian aubergine with sweet peppers. I chose Mas de Daumas Gassac white wine which would cost \u00a360 -\u00a370 in most restaurants but strangely it was only \u00a329 which is excellent value. Main courses of pan roasted halibut and Goosnargh duck were tasty but not spectacular. As we were finishing our main courses the other 5 tables had completed their meals and left the restaurant. It was only 2.30pm and the waitress was buzzing about at 100mph laying the tables for dinner. There was this feeling that we were getting in her way so we wolfed down a house chocolate Sensation and a Lemon sorbet and headed for the Savoy Hotel for coffee and brandy. The meal was good value for money but I like to relax in a restaurant and that didn't happen unfortunately.\nIt is a bold claim for any restaurant to make suggesting that it provides an \u2018unforgettable dining experience\u2019, and all the more so if you have also been voted London\u2019s \u2018most romantic\u2019 restaurant. Such is the standard that Clos Maggiore is forced to live up to. My comrade and I certainly thoroughly enjoyed a recent Saturday night here, but perhaps not as much as our initial visit around five years ago. In some ways, Clos Maggiore has become a victim of its own success; customers go here expecting to be both wowed and wooed. It is a place for special dinners and also for tourists, much more so than it can be considered an integral part of the high-end London dining scene. The main dining room definitely impresses: a beautiful conservatory adorned with apple blossom, fairy lights and a log fire, comprising just seven tables. We were lucky enough to benefit from one of these, although diners going here with high expectations may find them dashed should they be seated in the somewhat less glamorous ante room. We also could not help noticing, however, that even the atmosphere of the more intimate conservatory was slightly marred by the constant clicking of cameras and requests for couples to pose for obligatory photos taken by servers. Furthermore, table-turning is very much an active strategy here \u2013 particularly given the location of the restaurant proximate to theatre land - and so we also felt the ambience also diminished by the constant entry and exit of new couples, awaiting their experience. Nonetheless, before readers get the impression that this is a negative review, the above observations do constitute quibbles from a seasoned and sceptical London diner. On the positive side, the food and wine merit high praise and pricing is very competitive relative to other comparable locations. The approach at Clos Maggiore is billed as one of contemporary French cuisine, although the name of the restaurant also hints at a strong Italian influence too. Being a celebratory event, we enjoyed a glass of crisp and refreshing house champagne before moving onto the tasting menus, omnivorous for me, vegetarian for my comrade. We noted their relative originality (no scallop or steak on my menu, rather crab and duck as the highlights) and also a focus on simplicity rather than each dish comprising a list of obscure ingredients, coupled with jus and/or foam. Even something as relatively basic as my comrade\u2019s papardella with wild mushrooms and grated fresh truffle was prepared superbly with the flavours speaking for themselves. The paired wines also scored well, both for quality and originality. The sommelier had sourced good and inventive matches from Austria, Italy and Chile (among others) with relatively little reliance on France. For all this, at \u00a355/head (or \u00a390 with wines included), it is hard to complain. A little more charisma from some of the servers would have improved things further. In conclusion, Clos was pretty good, but it will probably be at least five years until we return again, given how many other options there are across London, whether for romantics or for fine diners.\nA quality experience from start to finish. Service unhurried but attentive. 5 course tasting menu delicately balanced and flavoured. Well informed and helpful sommelier.\nJust have to keep coming back!\nStrategy a wonderful fresh and clean combination on the palet. Main excellent and the duck succulent. Sweet, had to have it Black Icecream there's nothing like it; not too sweet and lovely to finish off.\nClos Maggiore has been around for many years, tucked fairly inconspicuously in King Street behind the Royal Opera House. Despite its well-appointed interior and charming door staff, you might just have a lingering initial suspicion that it's yet another over-priced, over-styled Covent Garden restaurant. You'd be wrong. This is the real deal: superb French food - with exotic Caribbean influences - and a magnificent wide-ranging wine list, all avaiable in a delightful, cosy, elegant setting at prices which are on the high side but not outrageous for what's on offer. In fact the food is nowadays so excellent that it seems inconceivable that a Michelin star has not wafted their way, but my advice is - get in there now before the award is made (as it surely must be!) and prices rise. Even the \u00a329.95 set menu (available at lunchtime and for pre- and post-theatre dining) offers a tempting choice of six starters, six mains and six puddings, and for a further \u00a310 includes a half bottle of wine - their choice, not yours. It's hard to choose what to eat, as everything on the menu sounds so attractive - but which then turns out to exceed expectations! After a half-dozen visits over the years, Clos Maggiore has now gone right to the upper end of my London dining lists, and maybe - at this price-level and in this area - right to the top. The only downside is the occasionally slightly grim-faced table service, but don't let that put you off. All in all the place is a treat. Go try.\nWe had an excellent meal for our anniversary yesterday. The restaurant is quite small and we had to wait a few minutes for our table. The service was excellent and the food we had was memorable; scallops on pigs trotters followed by loin of pork with delicious sauce.\nAfter a train down from the Midlands, a walk in the drizzle around the Tower of London to see the stupendous poppy installation, then to the National Gallery for the wonderful exhibition of Rembrandt's later works it occurred to me that a meal at 5 o'clock prior to our journey home might struggle to match the earlier part of the day. I needn't have worried as Clos Maggiore remains one of my favourite restaurants. A warm welcome then a chilled glass of champagne before our table was ready got my wife and I off to a good start. We were able to choose from the pre-theatre menu which is excellent value. I enjoyed my foie gras starter and my wife loved her herring and prawn dish. Mains were the chicken leg for me and smoked cod for madam. I loved mine, and the cod too was enjoyed, though possibly ever so slightly too salty. My whisky rice pudding was delightful and also my wife's chocolate dessert, most of which also came my way. The house white was perfectly acceptable, though I really enjoyed reading the wine list, which hopefully we can choose from at our next, more leisurely visit. Service really is very good and if you have never been then you certainly should go.\nPerfect for romantic dinners. But not just romantic dinners!\nI last visited Clos Maggiore about 10 years ago for dinner with friends and it was so good I hadn't been back. Sounds weird but I had it in my head that I should return for a really special romantic dinner and of course the 100% perfect excuse never quite arose. So I was delighted when a friend gave me another reason to visit when he booked the private dining room for a leaving-for-far-flung-shores lunch one weekend. It was the perfect spot for the occasion. There was just enough time and space for a pre-lunch mingle, lubricated by bubbles served by our discreet waiters. The room is quite tight, taken up mostly by a large dining table, but that keeps it intimate and antiqued mirror walls stop you feeling too boxed in. The table accommodated eighteen of us quite comfortably and it is sociably square shaped so you can still hold a conversation with everyone else around it. I don't normally like to be told there's a set menu with no choice but when it's Clos and it starts with a chicken liver and foie gras parfait it's a different matter. Every course was beautiful: think juicy show-stopper scallops and honey roast duck with tart roasted red plums. The only bum note was a pineapple parfait that had a strange half ice-cream/half sorbet texture. Top marks for fuss free amendments for those with dietary requirements (no seafood! no gluten! no taste!). The matched wines complemented the food well but the highlight for me was an intense, sticky port which accompanied the cheeses. Service throughout was great: professional and well paced, leaving us to enjoy the food and wine without pressure. The bill (5 courses, wines, coffee) came to \u00a3110 a head which I thought was reasonable but does put the restaurant in the \"special occasion\" category. I will have to find another such occasion before I another 10 years pass.\nI saw a review of this restaurant in magazine and as it was dubbed \u2018most romantic\u2019 restaurant in London so my husband and I decided to book. We booked at the end of February for a date in May and when we arrived we were not seated in the main restaurant. Instead we were seated near the bar in what looks like an add on for people who just happen to pop in on the off chance. The website and pictures are very deceiving. I asked if we could move tables to be in the main part and was told that they only have 5 tables for 2 and the people seated at them booked before us in January. My main message to anyone thinking of going is that when you book you must make sure that you ask to sit in the main garden part otherwise you could just as well be in any other restaurant in any other part of London. Most disappointed and feel very cheated by Clos Maggiore.\nOver the years the romantic atmosphere has not diminished and the cosy, faux foliage and conservatory with it's fire and mirrors still deliver a special romanticism. The fixed price evening menu for either 2 or 3 courses with a choice of 3 dishes per course is excellent value and unusually for a \u201cprix fixe\u201d the dish sizes are the same as from the a la carte menu. Wines offered stretch over the price and global range. The only negative is the service can be rushed as they openly try to turn the tables rather quickly, although they can be slowed down if you ask!"}

These shows tend to be 50-50 as a translation into acceptable viewing, I find. 50% worth a look and 50% worth avoiding like the black plague.\nThe show I saw was this one, and truthfully, I found it quite entertaining and informative. Being the first viewing, I\u2019m unsure of the usual panel make-up, but if this show is any guide, it seems there\u2019s two or three pollies, a boofhead and a comedian.

Timmy Blair surrounded by two up-and-coming politically astute and aware politicians, the Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art and spokesperson for a somewhat closeted conservative thinktank. Who\u2019s going to play the part of boofhead, I wonder?

The ensemble features an orchestra, a choir and traditional dances to braid together an enriching experience of Eastern Mediterranean music and the historically interconnected cultures of the larger region.\nEthnomusicologist and Director Ken Habib has been working closely with more than 25 musicians and singers to perfect the melodic and metric modes from the genres of this part of the world. San Luis Obispo Dance Director Jenna Mitchell will lead dancers in choreography that interacts with the complexities of the music. The concert will feature guest artists Ishmael on qanun (trapezoidal zither), Fathi Aljarrah on kamanja (violin) and Faisal Zedan on riqq (tambourine), daff (frame drum) and darabuka (goblet drum).\nA variety of instruments such as these will be used to shape a harmonious sound that delves into the traditional music of the Eastern Mediterranean region. This will all be in quarter tone, which is a unique pitch characteristic of these genres of music. The exposure to instruments and sound that students may not be familiar with will contribute to the distinct journey through the experience of AME.\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of the paradigm of Western European classical music, which is what the music departments in the United States historically have centered on, exclusively,\u201d Habib said.\nCal Poly music alumnus Brandon Webb noted the value of being exposed to a diverse variety of music outside of Western European classical music. Webb is the percussion section leader and is responsible for giving the drummers guidance and keeping a steady tempo for them. He will be playing the doumbek (goblet drum) as well the daff (frame drum).\nDespite the fact that some musicians involved with AME have not grown up with this specific kind of music, both those who are just learning it and those who have it weaved into their own roots can come together to collaborate in the ensemble.\n\u201cThe experience at AME is very divided between the people that want know more of the culture and the people that call this culture home. I know my fellow musician AJ and I have grown up with this kind of music and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very attached to,\u201d liberal arts and engineering studies senior Michelle Naziri said.\nHabib expressed that the AME has a following of people who have been attending the concert for years, some of whom also have this music embedded in their roots. He hopes the concert is sophisticated enough to resonate with this audience, but also transparent enough and multivalent enough to resonate with people who are hearing it for the first time.\n\u201cThe arts are an expression of reality in a way, just like the sciences are. We interact with our world \u2026 Human beings are intrinsically artistic. Music, for example, is, as far as we know, a part of every single society in the world and historically has always been a part of every single society in the world.\u201d Habib said.\nThe universality of music, along with the evidence of music as an essential part of history, demonstrates the richness of humanity, which Habib said we need to focus on by embracing our differences rather than being afraid of them. Regardless of musical literacy or experience, the AME said they hope the people who attend the concert will thoroughly enjoy it.\n\u201cI hope that they enjoy the musical experience of being, in a sense, a musical person in society because everybody is musical even if you don\u2019t sing or play an instrument, because we listen to it and appreciate it.\u201d Habib said.\nTickets are available at the Cal Poly Ticket Office with prices ranging from $12 to $14 for the public and $9 to $12 for students."}

{"sample_id": 1426, "text": "Hi everyone. Firstly I must apologise for the lack of blog posts in the last few weeks; in fact since 5 March when I posted the last one. I've had a manically busy few weeks having taken on a number of new clients. Also, I am preparing for a photo shoot of my flat in mid April which has been stressing me out somewhat. So I've been furiously upcycling some of my furniture with Annie Sloan paint (separate blog post shortly) and changing lampshades on all my table lamps.\nTable lamps can be so boring and serve no other purpose than to provide a lighting source. Gone are the days when you only had a limited choice of shades, mainly 50 shades of beige or cream!! Now you can buy the most divine shades and make a real statement, a wow factor, even if the lamp base is a bit \"meh\". The reverse is a statement lamp base with a plain shade that doesn't compete. However, beware as you can spend hundreds of pounds on a lamp shade and even thousands of pounds on a lamp base. It's a matter of finding something affordable and you really love.\nThere is a great shop in London called Pooky Lighting which sells affordable and fun lamp bases and shades so I popped in and bought three pairs of lampshades for the bedrooms and kitchen. What a difference they have made to the rooms; the lighting has transformed the spaces from \"meh\" to \"tah-dah\" !!!\nIn the kitchen I changed the shades from plain taupe coloured silk to these gorgeous silk Ikat pleated shades by Pooky Lights. In the sitting room I replaced a pair of beige linen shades in the alcoves with black & white Ikat ones which really draw the eye in.\nAnd finally, I bought a rather expensive but absolutely divine lamp base from Nicholas Haslam designed by Paolo Moschino. It is my piece de resistance but one of those items that you see and just have to have!!

What a great moment to have at last a name. I wanted her to grow and become so much more to me, so I continued digging.\nSource Information: Ancestry.com. North Carolina, Death Certificates, 1909-1975 [database on-line].\nI have often wondered if this entry from the North Carolina County Marriage Index is for my 3rd great grandparents.\nSource Information: Ancestry.com. North Carolina, Marriage Collection, 1741-2004 [database on-line].\nI've wondered if the middle initial \"H\" was for Hawkins. Perhaps this record was for another couple altogether.\nMary and Cesar Jones became property owners before 1900, a fact of which I am quite proud of. I learned of this when I reviewed Mary's will. Upon their deaths, my 3rd great grandparents were able to pass down a house and a lot, as well as 9 shares of Shepard's Point Land Company stock to their kids. You can read about the details of her will on my post Amanuensis Monday: The Will Of Mary Mitchel Jones.\nHere's an example of a Shepard's Point Land Company Stock Certificate.\nImage courtesy of the book, \"A Pictorial History Of Morehead City, 1714-1981\"\nIf you missed my post about her husband, Cesar Jones, you can click here."}

Painter Janet Werner paints portraits of people whom she has created or imagined, who take, or ape the role of family portraiture, simulating the familiar appearance of studio portraits.\nEstablished artist Micah Lexier\u2019s conceptual works encompass every non-traditional art material, exploring issues of time and age in his own life and experiences. Repositioning himself as the object of the artist\u2019s spectacle, he reworks the traditional situation of the artist as own model, presenting his own life through a variety of self-mythologised realms. For Beautiful Stranger Lexier has created a model of time called Gallery Hours in which visitors to the gallery at set times of the day receive an artists token in return for their participation in the work.\nThe Physics Room receives major funding from Creative New Zealand/Toi Aotearoa.\nBeautiful Stranger: an exhibition by three Canadian artists."}
