{"id": 3143, "text": "The 1932 NFL season was the 13th regular season of the National Football League. The Boston Braves (the current Washington Redskins) joined the NFL before the season, whereas the loss of the Providence Steam Roller, Cleveland Indians and Frankford Yellow Jackets dropped league membership to eight teams, the lowest in NFL history; the league also had eight teams in 1943 due to World War II.\nAlthough the Green Bay Packers finished the season with 10 wins, the league title was determined at the time by winning percentage with ties excluded, so the Portsmouth Spartans and the Chicago Bears finished the season tied for first place (6\u20131). Since both games between the teams ended in ties, the NFL arranged for the first ever playoff game to determine the NFL champion.\nExtremely cold weather forced the game to be moved from Wrigley Field to the indoor Chicago Stadium. The makeshift football field in the stadium was only 80 yards long with undersized endzones, forcing officials to move the goal posts to the goal line due to a lack of space to put them at the back of the end zone, as was standard in college and professional football. This change was favored by players and fans, and the goal posts were moved to the goal line as one of several rule changes the league made in 1933, with the rule lasting until 1973.\nThe Bears won the playoff game 9\u20130, which was scoreless until the fourth quarter, and as the game counted in the final standings, the Spartans finished in third place. The Spartans became the Detroit Lions in 1934.\nBecause the Portsmouth Spartans and the Chicago Bears finished the season tied for first place, a playoff game was held to determine the NFL champion.\nThe league decreased to eight teams in 1932.\nFollowing the 1932 season, the NFL would be split into two divisions (later two conferences), with the champions of each meeting in a championship game.\nThis was the result of the end of the 1932 season, where there was a tie for first in the standings at the end of the regular season: as tied games did not count until 1972, the Spartans record of 6\u20131\u20134 and the Bears record of 6\u20131\u20136 were taken to be six wins, one loss, giving both an .857 win percentage.\nHad pure win-loss differential or the current (post-1972) system of counting ties as half a win, half a loss been in place in 1932, the Packers' record of 10\u20133\u20131 (.750, +7) would have won them a fourth consecutive championship, ahead of the Spartans' 6\u20131\u20134 (.727, +5) and the Bears' 6\u20131\u20136 (.692, +5).\nThe Green Bay Packers were unbeaten (8\u20130\u20131) after nine games, and after the Thanksgiving weekend, their 10\u20131\u20131 record (.909) was still well ahead of Portsmouth at 5\u20131\u20134 (.833) and Chicago at 4\u20131\u20136 (.800).\nIn Week Twelve (December 4), the Spartans handed the Packers a 19\u20130 defeat, while the Bears beat the Giants 6\u20130. Portsmouth, at 6\u20131\u20134 (.857), took the lead, while the Packers (10\u20132\u20131) and the Bears (5\u20131\u20136) were tied for second (.833).\nIn Week Thirteen, the Bears hosted the Packers; a Green Bay win would have the Packers finish second with an 11\u20132\u20131 record (.846) and hand Portsmouth their first ever title. The Bears beat the Packers 9\u20130, meaning they finished 6\u20131\u20136, and tied for first in the standings with Portsmouth.\nThough it was described as a \"playoff\", the Bears 9\u20130 win over Portsmouth on December 18 counted in the regular season standings. As such, the Bears finished at 7\u20131\u20136 (.875) and won the 1932 title, with the Packers runners-up, and the Spartans, at 6\u20132\u20134 (.750), finished third.\nKenneth \"Ken\" R. Wendt (January 29, 1910 \u2013 January 19, 1982) was an American football player, jurist, and politician.\nWendt was a guard for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League in 1932. He then served in the Illinois General Assembly and as a judge in Cook County, Illinois.\nThe National Football League champions, prior to the merger between the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) in 1970, were determined by two different systems. The National Football League was established on September 17, 1920, as the American Professional Football Association (APFA). The APFA changed its name in 1922 to the National Football League, which it has retained ever since.From 1921 to 1931, the APFA/NFL determined its champion by overall win\u2013loss record, with no playoff games; ties were not counted in the winning percentage total. The APFA did not keep records of the 1920 season; they declared the Akron Pros, who finished the season with an 8\u20130\u20133 (8 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties) record, as the league's first champions, by a vote of the owners, with the Buffalo-All Americans and Decatur Staleys also claiming the title. According to modern-tie breaking rules, the Buffalo All-Americans tied Akron for the championship. The Canton Bulldogs won two straight championships from 1922 to 1923, and the Green Bay Packers won three in a row from 1929 to 1931.There also has been controversy over the championshipships of the 1921 APFA season and the 1925 NFL season, with the Buffalo All-Americans laying claim to another championship in an incident known as the \"Staley Swindle\" and the Pottsville Maroons being stripped of their championship in 1925 for playing an exhibition game against college football powerhouse Notre Dame's famed Four Horsemen, leading to a last minute field goal victory for the Maroons, stunning the crowd and nation, and also put the NFL ahead of college football for the first time ever. These three disputed championships contributed to the beginning of the NFL's rich history.\nThe 1932 NFL season resulted in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, and could not be resolved by the typical win\u2013loss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game in each of the four seasons before the completed merger. The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.The Green Bay Packers won the most NFL championships before the merger, winning eleven of the fifty championships. The Packers were also the only team to win three straight championships, an achievement they accomplished twice: from 1929\u201331 and from 1965\u201367. The Chicago Bears won a total of eight titles, and the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and New York Giants each won four. The Bears recorded the largest victory in a championship game, defeating the Washington Redskins 73\u20130 in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; six other title games ended in a shutout as well. The Philadelphia Eagles recorded two consecutive shutouts in 1948 and 1949. New York City hosted the most championship games (eight), while the highest-attended title game was the 1955 NFL Championship Game, where 85,693 fans showed up in Los Angeles to watch the Browns beat the Rams 38\u201314.\nStaten Island () is one of the five boroughs of New York City, in the U.S. state of New York.

{"id": 6006, "text": "Anti-Roma legislation as well as specific legal acts directed against the non-sedentary Roma population, justifying and legalizing the previously customary aversion towards the people and their prosecution, started to be drawn up and enacted in Western Europe in the early Modern era. Adam Bartosz in his book, Nie b\u00f3j si\u0119 Cygana. Na dara Romestar [Do Not Fear the Gypsy], lists only a few of these. According to the scholar and expert on Roma history, the first anti-Gypsy and anti-Egyptian \u2013 as they were known at the time \u2013 laws were issued in Lucerne in 1471 and barred the Roma from presence on the territory of Switzerland. At the close of the 15th century, the Roma were forbidden to follow their itinerant life style on pain of corporeal punishment and enslavement. In turn, the early 16th century was marked by anti-Roma legislation of the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, in the light of which the Roma captured on the imperial territory were subject to torture and extermination. In 1530, they were legally banished from England, and ten years later \u2013 from Scotland. Expulsion acts kept been issued in the 16th century, among other countries, in Denmark, Finland and France.\nIt is exactly this chronicle record as well as reports of aristocratic collections of severed limbs, noses and ears of the Roma captured during such battues, subsequently exhibited in cabinets of curiosities or in palace rooms alongside hunting trophies, recoverable from the sources as late as mid-19th century, which has inspired the work of Krzysztof Gil.\nThe Polish-Romani artist has produced a species of installation, composed of a cubical room of his design and making, and of sound. In its form, dimensions and execution technique, the cubic shed put together from accidental pieces of wood and fabric alludes to traditional, humble, temporary houses erected by the legally and socially marginalised Roma. On the other hand, repeating the paradigmatic form of a gallery white cube, it constructs a literally Chinese-box situation, whence it positions the audience. Since the cubical installation, upon entrance, turns out to a self-contained exhibition space, whose darkened interior appears to be a dialectical antithesis of the space of a gallery.\nInside the one-chamber room, Krzysztof Gil installed a panoramic painting. The cylindrical panorama consists of a majestic and monumental, white-crayon drawing on black background, representing a scene of game display. The image, which follows the representational convention for hunting trophies, is composed of likenesses of genteel women and men, clothed in modern hunters\u2019 and their female companions\u2019 apparel. All images used by the artist have been appropriated from painting of the old masters. In the surrounding darkness, the light rhythmically reveals characters, whose prototypes become identifiable as members of the surgeons\u2019 guild depicted by Rembrandt, for example, or as St. Irene attending to the body of St. Sebastian from Georges de la Tour\u2019s painting. The composition centre holds, amidst hunted game, a de-faced \u2013 as profil-perdu painted \u2013 torso of an anonymous, shut-down Roma.\nKrzysztof Gil\u2019s use of the convention of appropriation, historicising his piece, is at once a sarcastic comment, in the spirit of Reger from Thomas Bernhard\u2019s Old Masters, on European art as a history painted in bright colours, and an accusation levelled against it. On the other hand, thanks to the sound accompanying the visible, a remote history becomes juxtaposed to the contemporary and to the artist\u2019s private, family history.\nThe sound-track accompanying our viewing of his panorama is fragments of a record of a conversation Krzysztof Gil conducted with his grand-mother. She tells the story of her father \u2013 a musician and a brick-layer \u2013 murdered after WWII in the Podhale region, because he had had the audacity to make a remark about a poorly executed work to his Polish co-workers. Upon arrival on the scene of crime, the militiamen and doctors found the event to be a misadventure. The perpetrators went unpunished.\nThe artist\u2019s family history, which has been combined here with an event described in a 17th-century chronicle, demonstrates that the ritual Heidenjachten are not really a closed chapter of history, and that anti-Roma violence remains a notorious occurrence. It is confirmed also by the exhibition title, which we have borrowed from a contemporary photograph found on the Internet, representing a caption on a wall of a Polish city. The paint appeared to still be wet."}

{"id": 9724, "text": "Modelling movement is an important topic in fields ranging from ecology to medicine. In particular, glioma, an often fatal brain tumour is characterised by its diffuse invasion into the surrounding normal brain tissue, enabling the tumour to escape therapy. In this thesis we focus on the mathematical modelling of glioma and movement in general. We begin by exploring the basic structure of the brain, describing glioma classification and the hallmarks of cancer as well as reviewing mathematical models of glioma. In Chapter 2 an Ordinary Differential Equation model is presented to describe the interaction between healthy and mutated cells in vivo and vitro scenarios. The model is extended to a Partial Differential Equation to cover the spatial dynamics of interaction and the possibility of travelling wave solutions. A leading hypothesis suggests that malignant glioma cells switch between proliferating and migrating phenotypes, a mechanism known as the \u201cgo or grow\u201d hypothesis. Although the molecular mechanisms that control this switch are uncertain, it is generally assumed to depend on micro-environmental factors. In Chapter 3 we propose a simple mathematical model based on the go or grow hypothesis for brain tumours (gliomas). The model describes the competition between healthy glial cells and malignant cells, with the latter subdivided into invasive and proliferating subpopulations. Simulation and stability analysis is performed for spatial and non-spatial versions of the model. The model incorporates two types of switch between migration and proliferation glioma cells: a constant switch form and a density dependent form. In Chapter 4 we present a framework for modelling a different characteristic movement lengths based on a biased random walk in response to external control species. We use the model to understand different strategies by which a population may locate some resource in its environment. Further we consider a pilot application to glioma, showing how it can be used to model movement along different brain structures. Finally we conclude with a brief discussion that summarises the main results and highlights directions for future work."}

However, the contribution of the particles to many physical properties is realized at high concentrations. In this study, nanocomposites were prepared with transparent polystyrene (PS) and organophilic CeO2 nanoparticles using various compositions in which the particle content was up to 95 wt%. The particles, capped by 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), were dispersed into PS and the transmittance of the spin-coated composite films was examined over the UV-visible region. When the particle concentration was <20 wt%, the transmittance of the films showed a first-order exponential decay as the Rayleigh scattering theory proposes. However, a positive deviation was observed from the decay function for higher particle contents. The improvement in transmittance may be a consequence of interference in the multiple scattering of light by the quasi-ordered internal microstructure that gradually develops as the particle concentration increases."}

{"id": 9249, "text": "Thermochemolysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were applied to determine the structure of humic acids (HA) extracted from a sewage sludge and straw mixture at different steps of composting. The HA extracted from sludge mixture released various compounds, such as mono-, di-, tri-methoxy (alkyl) benzene and (alkyl) benzoic acids, which originated from lignin like derivatives of phydroxyphenyl, guiaicyl and syringyl units. In addition, other aromatic non-lignin derived structures were found along with series of branched C15, linear C16, C18 fatty acid methyl esters. The follow-up of various lignin-derived units during composting shows a decrease in phydroxyphenyl type-compounds (C) after the stabilisation phase. In parallel the more oxidized units, derived from guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units, corresponding mainly to methylated derivatives of cafeic acids, protocatechuic acids, gallic acids and aldehydes, significantly increased in comparison with the other aromatic structures. Various ratios commonly used as parameters to determine the degree of lignin decomposition during humification were followed to monitor the chemical structure changes of the HA extracted from sludge mixture during composting. In the present case, the S/G ratio did not present significant changes during composting. The acid/aldehyde ratio was supervised using the ratio of gallic acids to gallic aldehyde methylated derivatives and showed an increase from 0.73 to 2.13 after the stabilisation phase but a decrease to 0.93 at the end of composting. This evolution may be explained by the increase of acid-containing derivatives following the intense oxidation of lignin side-chains during the stabilisation phase. But, the decrease of the acid/aldehyde ratio during the maturation phase could be attributed to a decrease in acid units by polymerisation of benzoic acid type-compounds through ester/ether linkages. The follow up of six families of compounds of similar chemical structures during composting showed a decrease of lignin-type compounds C6\u2013C3 and that C6\u2013C1 units predominated in the humic acid isolated from end compost sludge. The fatty acid methyl esters showed an increase in the intermediate phase of composting probably originating from the activities and tissues of microorganisms, which are numerous during the process. The final decrease in the amount of fatty acids may be explained by the death of most of the microbial population at the end of composting typified by a low respiratory rate. The index of Shannon-Weaver (Ish) remained constant at about 3 in course of composting indicating the neoformation of HA from subunits of similar chemical nature. A similitude index (Sij, S0 i j) showed a split between 30 and 90 days of composting indicating a change in the rate of neoformation of HA after a stabilisation phase. Afterwards, the rate of HA neoformation varied linearly with the duration of composting."}

{"id": 2782, "text": "Jesus' Apostles ordained bishops, who in turn ordained the next generation of bishops. This continuous line of ordination, called the apostolic succession, has continued down to the present day. Thus the authority for the ordination of a new bishop today could theoretically be traced back as far as the individual Apostles -- except that accurate records were not kept in the early decades of Christianity.\nThe gospel message started in a state of purity. There was a consensus on all beliefs. All of the subsequent heretical movements represented deviations from this initial state.\nThe Bible describes Jerusalem as being the initial center of Christianity, with James the brother of Jesus at its head.\nThe book of Acts, Paul's epistles, and others describe Paul as being the main founder and supreme authority of the Gentile churches -- that is of Pauline Christianity. Meanwhile, Jesus' disciples formed the Jewish Christian movement centered in Jerusalem, under the leadership of James, the brother of Jesus.\nPeter probably did not write any part of the Christian Scriptures (New Testaments). 1 Peter was probably not written by Peter; 2 Peter certainly was not.\nAlthough churches are mentioned in the Christian Scriptures (as in Revelation 1:4) they are described as independent groups who met in believers' homes. They were apparently not part of a religious organization that is centrally controlled from Rome.\nSiricius, who reigned at the end of the 4th century CE, was the first bishop of Rome to be called pope.\nPope Leo I, who reigned from 440 to 461 CE was the first to claim that the bishop of Rome was highest ranking of the bishops of the church.\nIt took many centuries before the pope could speak for the church. Before that, all decisions affecting Christendom had to be settled by all of the bishops meeting together, as at the Council of Nicea in 325 CE.\nThe early Pauline congregations were informal faith communities. A formal, hierarchical organization only came much later.\nExcept for the first few years after Jesus' execution, there was no consensus of belief among Christians. The movement was split into many different groups, each teaching different belief system. The main ones were Gnostic Christianity, Jewish Christianity and Pauline Christianity. Often, there were a number of Christian congregations in the larger cities with competing and conflicting messages.\nMatthew 16:18-19: \"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" (King James Version) The Greek word \"ekklesia\" is translated as church in the King James Version of the Bible. Catholics typically interpret \"ekklesia\" as referring to a formal church organization. This passage thus assigns Peter the responsibility to begin to assemble a great monolithic religious organization with Peter as its initial head. Many Protestant theologians generally interpret the word as referring to an informal faith community, vaguely similar to today's independent house churches and cell churches. Some liberals interpret this passage as a simple pun without any deeper significance. In Jesus' language, Aramaic or Syro-Chaldaic, the word \"Cephas\" meant both the name \"Peter,\" and the word \"rock.\" Also the word translated as \"this\" is more accurately translated as \"this very.\" So the 18th verse could be translated into modern English \"...you are Rocky, and upon this very rock I will build my church.\"\n1 Corinthians 3:10-11: \"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.\tFor other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" (KJV) This statement by Paul appears to credit himself (and not Peter) as the master builder who has laid the foundation of the church, up on which others are to build further. It contains no reference to Peter's contribution.\nEphesians 2:19-22: \"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.\" (KJV) This statement by Paul credits all of the Apostles (presumably including himself) and prophets as forming the symbolic foundation of the church, with Jesus Christ being the main corner stone. Peter appears to be considered as simply one Apostle among equals.\n1 Peter 2:2-6: \"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.\" (KJV) The Catholic church doubts that Peter wrote this epistle, and attributes probable authorship to a disciple of Peter, perhaps Silvanus. 5 It says that all believers form part of a \"spiritual house, an holy priesthood,\" with Jesus as cornerstone. The contribution of Peter appears to be as one believer among many equals.\nThe original 12 disciples, less Judas plus Matthias (chosen in Acts 1).\nall of the Apostles and prophets, with Jesus as cornerstone.\nall Christians, with Jesus as cornerstone.\nThe lack of earlier non biblical references might have been due to those writings having been lost. Very few writings survived from that era. An alternative interpretation is that the concept of Peter founding the Christian church in Rome did not develop until after the middle of the 2nd century CE.\n211 CE: Tertullian wrote: \"...remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church...\" (\"Antidote Against the Scorpion,\" 10).\nWere leaders in Rome recognized as the head of the Christian religion?\nSome ancient letters have been cited as proof of a functioning Pope in Rome who controlled all of Christendom. Some date from the late 1st century to the late 2nd century CE.\n80 CE: About 15 years after the executions of Peter and Paul, Clement of Rome wrote a letter to the church at Corinth. He apparently was recommending that the Corinthians expel \"a few rash and self-willed persons\" who have promoted \"abominable and unholy sedition.\" He asks the church to \"Accept our counsel and you will have nothing to regret...If anyone disobey the things which have been said by him [God] through us let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and in no small danger...You will afford us joy and gladness if being obedient to the things which we have written through the Holy Spirit, you will root out the wicked passion of jealousy\" (Letter to the Corinthians 1:1, 58:2-59:1, 63:2). He is claiming to know the will of God and the Holy Spirit. He appears to be write the letter as a Christian leader, much like Paul's letters to the same group at Corinth. But, it is not clear whether he is writing as the supreme authority within Christendom, i.e. as the pope. It is worth noting that Clement seems to have written this document some 8 years before the Roman Catholic church believes that he became pope. If the Church is correct in its dates, then Clement did not write the letter as a pope.\n80 CE: Hermas wrote \"Therefore shall you [Hermas] write two little books and send one to Clement and one to Grapte. Clement shall then send it to the cities abroad, because that is his duty.\" (The Shepherd 2:4:3). Clement is described as having the responsibilities of a type of corresponding secretary for the churches \"abroad.\" Again, this letter appears to have been written some 8 years before the Roman Catholic church believes that he became pope.\n110 CE: Ignatius of Antioch wrote a letter \"...to the church also which holds the presidency, in the location of the country of the Romans, worthy of God, worthy of honor, worthy of blessing, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy of sanctification, and, because you hold the presidency in love, named after Christ and named after the Father\" (Letter to the Romans 1:1). Ignatius seems to view Christendom as being composed of a number of churches of which the one at Rome is the most important; it holds \"the presidency.\" It makes sense that the Roman congregation would be considered the principal Christian church, early in the 2nd century. It was located at Rome, which was the economic, cultural, educational, and political center of the known world. However, Ignatius' letter says nothing about a single individual, a pope, within the Roman congregation controlling the rest of the the churches.\nFrom the 3rd century onwards, there is a consensus within the Roman Catholic church that each generation of bishops were ordained by previously ordained bishops. The church teaches that the original bishops were ordained by the Apostles, who in turn had been ordained by Jesus. 8 This continuous, unbroken line of ordination from Jesus to modern-day bishops is called the \"Apostolic Succession.\"\nCirca 260 CE: Firmilian wrote: \"Christ breathed upon the Apostles alone, saying to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive any man his sins they shall be forgiven, and if you retain any man's sins they shall be retained.' The power of forgiving sins was given to the apostles and the churches which these men, sent by Christ, established and to the bishops who succeeded them by being ordained in their place.\" (Epistle to Cyprian, 75:16).\nWhether there were any bishops (in the modern meaning of that term) in the 1st century CE is a topic of debate among theologians.\n\"Diakonoi\" - which has been variously translated as deacons, helpers, aides.\nBut their exact roles and levels of authority are not defined, and can only be guessed at.\nMany conservative Protestants frequently believe that Paul wrote them early in the 7th decade CE (perhaps during the years 62 to 64).\nMost liberals say that the author(s) are unknown and that the books were written much later, in the first half of the 2nd century.\nR.C.

{"id": 2432, "text": "Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc.\nNintendo designed a program, the 10NES, for its Nintendo Entertain System (NES) to prevent the NES from accepting unauthorized game cartridges. The 10NES was programmed onto chips located in the NES console and in each game cartridge. Thus, only 10NES-enabled cartridges could \u201cunlock\u201d access to the NES console.\nAfter a failed attempt to replicate the 10NES program, Atari, in December 1987, licensed the technology from Nintendo under strict licensing terms. Nintendo themselves placed Atari\u2019s games in 10NES-enabled cartridges, and limited Atari, as well as other licensees, to five new NES games per year.\nIn early 1988, Atari applied to the Copyright Office for a reproduction of the 10NES source code, which the Copyright Office provided to Atari based on a false allegation by Atari that Atari needed the copy for pending litigation. There in fact was no pending litigation.\nBased on the acquired source code, Atari developed its own program, the Rabbit program, which generated signals indistinguishable from the 10NES program and gave Atari access to the NES without Nintendo\u2019s license conditions. The line-by-line instructions of the programs vary because Atari used a different microprocessor and programming language.\nNintendo brought suit against Atari alleging copyright infringement (and patent infringement, among other allegations). Atari brought several claims against Nintendo and asserted a copyright misuse defense. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted Nintendo\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction based on copyright infringement. Atari appealed.\nThe Federal Circuit observed that while it had jurisdiction based on patent infringement claims included in the action, the court applies the law of the regional circuits, the Ninth Circuit in this case, to resolve issues of copyright law.\nThe Federal Circuit stated that \u201c[t]o prevail on its copyright infringement claim, Nintendo must show ownership of the 10NES program copyright and copying by Atari of protectable expression from the 10NES program.\u201d Ownership of the 10NES program was not in dispute, and thus, Nintendo had to prove only the copying of protectable expression.\nNext, the court held that \u201cNintendo is likely to show successfully that Atari infringed the 10NES copyright by obtaining and copying the source code from the Copyright Office.\u201d Atari obtained a copy from the Copyright Office by providing false information about a pending litigation, therefore obtaining an unauthorized reproduction. Thus, Atari infringed Nintendo\u2019s copyright based on the reproduction of an unauthorized copy from the Copyright Office.\nThe court then also held that \u201cNintendo is likely to prove substantial similarity between the Rabbit and 10NES programs sufficient to support its infringement claims.\u201d The court primarily relied on the fact that Rabbit incorporated unnecessary features, including features that were deleted from the original 10NES program. Thus, the court concluded that \u201ccopying of fully extraneous instructions unnecessary to the 10NES program\u2019s functionality\u201d suggests copying, not independent creation.\nAtari argued as a defense to copyright infringement that Nintendo misused its copyright. Because there was no statutory basis for the copyright misuse defense, the court determined that the defense was solely an equitable doctrine. Therefore, while copyright misuse may be a viable defense, any party seeking the defense must have clean hands. Atari was ineligible to invoke the defense because of its lie to the Copyright Office to obtain a copy of the 10NES program.\nThe court therefore held that the district court did not err by granting the preliminary injunction against Atari."}

It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.\nIn that context, Holland focuses on the birth of Islam through the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (modern-day Saudi Arabia) during the course of the seventh century, as it is told to us by one of Mohammed\u2019s biographers, Ibn Hisham, in the ninth century. The faith of Islam, as Holland points out, is centred on the study and strict observation of both the divine revelations to Mohammed (the Koran), and how Mohammed acted during his lifetime (the Hadith and the Sunna).\nYet, echoing what many (mostly non-Muslim) scholars have queried before, Holland points to the historical problem of the evidence: before 800AD, almost 200 years after Mohammed\u2019s death in 632AD, the only \u201ctraces we possess\u201d for the development of Islam \u201care either the barest shreds of shreds, or else the delusory shimmering of mirages\u201d.\nHolland examines late antiquity not as an age of decline and fall, but of energy and inventiveness, setting the Arab world and Mohammed\u2019s life in the context of the changing geographies, cultures and priorities of the empires of Rome around the Mediterranean, the Sassanians to the East, and the religious and cultural melting-pot of the \u201cHoly Land\u201d, which connected them. Holland identifies key events, places, ideas and decisions within the Persian and Roman systems which may have impacted upon the Arab world, and, in turn, on the birthplace of Islam in Mecca and Medina.\nIn so doing, Holland argues for the forging of Islam in the political and military instability and opportunity of a world convulsed by a changing balance of power. The process, he continues, ensured that, by the ninth century, \u201ca version of Islam\u2019s beginnings that gave no scope for anyone to rule as a Deputy of God\u201d, and in turn no room \u201cfor acknowledging the momentous role in the forging of Islam by countless others\u201d, had gained acceptance, the continued presence of which, inevitably, makes Holland\u2019s thesis difficult reading for an Islamic audience.\nFocusing on the wider context to unpick key moments in history is a classic Holland approach, echoing, for example, his study of the fifth century BC Persian invasion of Greece in Persian Fire (2005), which explored the context and prior history of the Persian and Greek worlds. Such an approach is now in vogue, because it demands that the historian break the often stifling disciplinary boundaries that have traditionally governed the study of worlds which knew no such boundaries.\nThis is a handsome volume, tackling an important question from a novel perspective, backed by useful notes and written in an accessible and fluid style. But, as I am sure Holland would accept, in part because of the charged nature of the material and issues on which it dwells, and in part because of the vast developments and arenas it attempts to encompass, it is also bound to encounter the full spectrum of critical reaction."}

METHODS: The proliferation of PC-3 cells were analyzed by MTT and H3-TdR incorporation. The effects of cell cycle and apoptosis of synchronized cells were observed through flow cytometry. RT-PCR methods were used to explore the mRNA expression level of cyclin D1, bcl-2, bax. RESULTS: The growth and DNA synthesis of PC-3 cell were inhibited with the lycopene concentration increased, and lycopene also could change the cell cycle distribution, i. e. increasing the proportion of G0/G1 phase and descending the proportion of S and G2/M phase, and induce the apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression level of cyclin D1 and bcl-2 were down regulated, while the level of bax was up regulated. CONCLUSION: Lycopene can induce apoptosis of PC-3, change the cell cycle distribution and downregulate the expression of cyclin D1 and bcl-2 and upregulate the expression of bax and then restrain cell proliferation."}

{"id": 4522, "text": "Proposed pathways for movement of magnesium (Mg) across the intestinal epithelium. Two possible routes exist for the absorption of Mg across intestinal epithelial cells: the transcel-lular route and the intercellular pathway. Although a transcellular route has not yet been demonstrated, its existence is inferred from several observations. No large chemical gradient exists for Mg movement across the cell membrane; however, a significant uphill electrical gradient exists for the exit of Mg from cells. This finding suggests the existence and participation of an energy-dependent mechanism for extrusion of Mg from intestinal cells. If such a system exists, it is believed it would consist of two stages. 1) Mg would enter the apical membrane of intestinal cells by way of a passive carrier or facilitated diffusion. 2) An active Mg pump in the basolateral section of the cell would extrude Mg. The intercellular movement of Mg has been demonstrated to occur by both gradient-driven and solvent-drag mechanisms. This intercellular path may be the only means by which Mg moves across the intestinal epithelium. The change in transport rates at low Mg concentrations would reflect changes in the \"openness\" of this pathway. High concentrations of luminal Mg (eg, after a meal) are capable of altering the morphology of the tight junction complex. High local Mg concentrations near the intercellular junction also can affect the activities of local membrane-associated proteins (eg, sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphate [Na-K ATPase]) near the tight junction and affect its permeability (see Fig. 4-6) [13-15]."}

{"id": 7236, "text": "\"The intention was to confer the privilege of citizenship upon that class of persons whom the fathers knew as white, and to deny it to all who could not be so classified.\"\nT akao Ozawa was born in Japan, moved to the territory of Hawaii, and later lived in California. Altogether he had lived in the United States continuously for twenty years when he applied in 1914 for naturalization, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. At the time, he had graduated from high school in Berkeley, California, and had been a student at the University of California for three years. He had children, all born in the United States. The family spoke English at home and attended American churches. Nevertheless, the U.S. government opposed his application to become a citizen, on grounds that he was not \"white.\" Eight years after his application was filed, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the government: Ozawa was not eligible to become a citizen.\n1894, as Japan was emerging as a strong military and industrial power in Asia, a treaty with the United States had guaranteed free immigration to the United States for Japanese. But six years later, in the midst of strong opposition to Japanese immigrants among European Americans in California, Japan agreed not to issue passports for laborers seeking to enter the United States. (A passport is the formal travel document issued by a country's government that allows a citizen of that country exit and reentry.) For the Japanese government, it was a way to cut off emigration and solve the problem without agreeing to treatment that would be regarded as discriminatory against Japanese. The cutoff of passports did not, however, include passports for laborers seeking to enter Hawaii, Canada, or Mexico, from any one of which it was easy for Japanese to enter the United States.\nIn 1907, the San Francisco Board of Education decided to segregate its Asian students. All Asian students, including Japanese students, were to be placed in a single \"Asian school\" that kept the students apart from \"white\" European American students. Seeing Japanese the objects of discrimination upset the government of Japan just at the moment when the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858\u20131919; served 1901\u20139) wanted to maintain smooth diplomatic relations with Japan. Roosevelt, who was eager to increase U.S. influence in east Asia, was counting on Japan to counter the influence of Russia in the region.\nTo cool the diplomatic tensions with Japan created by the school board in San Francisco, Roosevelt persuaded the school board to drop its segregation plan in exchange for promises that the federal government would try to solve the issue of Japanese immigration. The result was the \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (an agreement that falls short of a formal treaty) of 1907 under which Japan agreed to cooperate in stemming the flow of Japanese workers to the United States. The Japanese government said it would continue to refuse to issue passports for all Japanese workers planning to go to the United States. In addition, it would not object to the removal of Japanese from the United States who held passports issued for travel elsewhere, such as Canada or Mexico. In return, San Francisco authorities discontinued segregating Japanese students in a special school for Asians. Officially, Japanese still had the right to immigrate, on an equal basis with citizens of other countries.\nThe San Francisco school board incident demonstrated how U.S. immigration laws and attitudes affected American diplomatic policies unrelated to immigration. The incident also served as a reminder of the long-standing controversy in California over the admission of people from Asia, whether Japanese or Chinese, and the importance of race in determining U.S. policy. As early as 1790, the Congress had passed a law limiting citizenship to immigrants who were \"free white persons.\" At the time it was adopted, the law was intended to deny citizenship to slaves from Africa. Seventy-five years later, after slavery was abolished, the immigration law was amended to include Africans and people of African descent\u2014but nothing was said about Asians.\nWith many Americans displeased with immigration from Asia (and also from southern and eastern Europe), the U.S. district attorney (prosecutor) had objected when Ozawa applied for citizenship. The government, in its arguments to the Supreme Court, admitted that Ozawa would make a good citizen: He was well educated; his family spoke English at home and attended church; and he had lived in the United States for most of his life. There was nothing in his conduct that might suggest he would make a poor citizen. Nevertheless, the government argued in court that U.S. law had been clear, since 1790: \"Any alien being a free white person \u2026 may be admitted to become a citizen.\" The only exception was made in the Naturalization Act of 1870, which also made Africans or people of African descent eligible to become naturalized citizens. Ozawa did not fit any of these categories, in the government's opinion.\nOzawa's lawyers cited inconsistencies in the way that U.S. immigration laws had been written. They argued that when Congress passed a new naturalization law in 1906, it intended to overhaul the immigration law completely. Since the 1906 law had not specifically barred citizenship for Japanese people (as other laws specifically barred Chinese people), Ozawa's lawyers argued that he deserved to become a naturalized citizen. But the Supreme Court said no, ruling that if Congress had intended to remove the racial limitations on naturalized citizenship, it would have done so explicitly and decisively, rather than simply ignoring the issue. The Supreme Court noted that limiting citizenship to free white persons had been the law since 1790 and that the law had only been amended to include people born in Africa or of African descent. No such exception was ever made for Japanese, which both sides on the argument described as being a separate \"race.\"\nThe Supreme Court also ruled on two other questions raised in the case: first, whether someone from Japan could be considered \"white\" under the law; and second, whether Ozawa could be barred from becoming a citizen because of race.\nOn the first question, Ozawa's lawyers had argued that the original immigration laws referred to \"free white persons\" in order to distinguish them from enslaved Africans, or \"black,\" people. The lawyers tried to persuade the court that \"white\" meant \"not black,\" and that the phrase was not intended to exclude Asians. The court's opinion rejected the argument, holding that people from Japan were not considered to be \"Caucasian,\" which was what the law meant by \"white,\" and were therefore not eligible to become citizens.\nOn the second question, the court ruled that Congress did have the power under the Constitution to determine the basis on which immigrants could become citizens, even if the basis was a concept as vague as race.\nThe Ozawa decision was significant in the history of immigration to the United States because it reconfirmed the importance of race when deciding whether immigrants should be allowed to become citizens\u2014a standard for eligibility that had existed since the very beginnings of the United States as an independent country. The ruling came at a period of history when prejudice against racial and religious minorities was very strong among European American citizens, a fact that was not lost on the justices of the Supreme Court.\nThe Ozawa case came before the court at a time when the United States had already begun to restrict immigrants, especially those from southern and eastern Europe. For the forty years preceding the case, a higher number of Europeans than ever before had come to the United States, including many from poor areas of southern and eastern Europe. The case was decided in an era when the idea of \"race\" seemed highly important to many Americans, who were disturbed by the large number of darker-skinned individuals from countries around the Mediterranean. Although the Supreme Court is intended to interpret what Congress might have meant in passing laws, and making sure those laws do not conflict with the U.S. Constitution (the basic law of the land), in reality justices of the court usually have a political background and are often sensitive to the public sentiments of the time.\nThe concept of race has always been vague, as the court's opinion admits. What race is the child of a black mother and a white father, for example? The court's opinion brushes aside this fundamental issue by saying that such questions fall into a \"zone of more or less debatable ground.\" But since Ozawa had been born in Japan, the issue of his race was not subject to question: He was not white, and therefore not eligible to become a citizen.\nThe court's opinion carefully examined minute details of previous immigration laws in an effort to understand what Congress intended to do. On the subject of what constitutes a \"white\" person, the opinion in essence says the court did not have time to study the issue from a scientific basis. The court ruled that anyone who was not a \"free white person\" (or who was not born in Africa or of African descent) did not fall into the category of people eligible to become citizens, and that included people from Asia. On the question of whether the authors of the 1790 law intended to exclude Asians, the court simply said that it has no power to read the minds of the authors of the original law. Since no subsequent Congress changed the wording, the court had no power to rule otherwise.\nThe act of June 29, 1906, entitled \"An act to establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and to provide for a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens throughout the United States,\" consists of 31 sections and deals primarily with the subject of procedure. There is nothing in the circumstances leading up to or accompanying the passage of the act which suggests that any modification of section 2169, or of its application, was contemplated.\n\"It is the opinion of your committee that the frauds and crimes which have been committed in regard to naturalization have resulted more from a lack of any uniform system of procedure in such matters than from any radical defect in the fundamental principles of existing law governing in such matters. The two changes which the committee has recommended in the principles controlling in naturalization matters and which are embodied in the bill submittedherewith are as follows: First, the requirement that before an alien can be naturalized he must be able to read, either in his own language or in the English language and to speak or understand the English language; and, second, that the alien must intend to reside permanently in the United States before he shall be entitled to naturalization.\"\nThis seems to make it quite clear that no change of the fundamental character here involved was in mind\u2026.\n\"Any alien being a free white person \u2026 may be admitted to become a citizen\u2026.\" 1 Stat. 103, c. 3.\nThis was subsequently enlarged to include aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent\u2026.\nIn all of the naturalization acts from 1790 to 1906 the privilege of naturalization was confined to white persons (with the addition in 1870 of those of African nativity and descent), although the exact wording of the various statutes was not always the same. If Congress in 1906 desired to alter a rule so well and so long established it may be assumed that its purpose would have been definitely disclosed and its legislation to that end put in unmistakable terms\u2026.\nIt is the duty of this Court to give effect to the intent of Congress. Primarily this intent is ascertained by giving the words their natural significance, but if this leads to an unreasonable result plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole, we must examine the matter further. We may then look to the reason of the enactment and inquire into its antecedent history and give it effect in accordance with its design and purpose, sacrificing, if necessary, the literal meaning in order that the purpose may not fail\u2026. We are asked [by Ozawa's lawyers] to conclude that Congress, without the consideration or recommendation of any committee, without a suggestion as to the effect, or a word of debate as to the desirability, of so fundamental a change, nevertheless, by failing to alter the identifying words of section 2169 , which section we may assume was continued for some serious purpose, has radically modified a statute always theretofore maintained and considered as of great importance. It is inconceivable that a rule in force from the beginning of the government, a part of our history as well as our law, welded into the structure of our national polity by a century of legislative and administrative acts and judicial decisions, would have been deprived of its force in such dubious and casual fashion. Weare, therefore, constrained to hold that the act of 1906 is limited by the provisions of section 2169 of the Revised Statutes.\nAntecedent: Referring to a preceding event, condition, or cause.\nLiteral: Referring to accepting the exact meaning of the words of a statement or opinion and allowing no further interpretation.\nSection 2169: A sentence in the naturalization law that said naturalization \"shall apply to aliens, being free white persons and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\" Ozama's lawyers argued that because this sentence did not explicitly ban Japanese from becoming naturalized citizens, Congress did not intend to bar Japanese from becoming citizens when it passed a naturalization law in 1906.\nSecond. This brings us to inquire whether, under section 2169, the appellant is eligible to naturalization. The language of the naturalization laws from 1790 to 1870 had been uniformly such as to deny the privilege of naturalization to an alien unless he came within the description \"free white person. By section 7 of the act of July 14, 1870 \u2026, the naturalization laws were \"extended to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\" Section 2169 of the Revised Statutes, as already pointed out, restricts the privilege to the same classes of persons, viz. \"to aliens being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\" It is true that in the first edition of the Revised Statutes of 1873 the words in brackets, \"being free white persons, and to aliens\" were omitted, but this was clearly an error of the compilers and was corrected by the subsequent legislation of 1875\u2026. Is appellant, therefore, a \"free white person,\" within the meaning of that phrase as found in the statute?\nAppellant: A person bringing a lawsuit from a lower court to a higher court for a new hearing.\nOn behalf of the appellant it is urged that we should give to this phrase the meaning which it had in the minds of its original framers in 1790 and that it was employed by them for the sole purpose of excluding the black or African race and the Indians then inhabiting this country. It may be true that those two races were alone thought of as being excluded, but to say that they were the only ones within the intent of the statute would be to ignore the affirmative form of the legislation. The provision is not that Negroes and Indians shall be excluded, but it is, in effect, that only free white persons shall be included. The intention was to confer the privilege of citizenship upon that class of persons whom the fathers knew as white, and to deny it to all who could not be so classified. It is not enough to say that the framers did not have in mind the brown or yellow races of Asia. It is necessary to go farther and be able to say that had these particular races been suggested the language of the act would have been so varied as to include them within its privileges\u2026.\nAffirmative form: The structure of a phrase denoting assent or agreement.\nFramers: Those who wrote the Constitution.\nIf it be assumed that the opinion of the framers was that the only persons who would fall outside the designation \"white\" were Negroes and Indians, this would go no farther than to demonstrate their lack of sufficient information to enable them to foresee precisely who would be excluded by that term in the subsequent administration of the statute. It is not important in construing their words to consider the extent of their ethnological knowledge or whether they thoughtthat under the statute the only persons who would be denied naturalization would be Negroes and Indians. It is sufficient to ascertain whom they intended to include and having ascertained that it follows, as a necessary corollary , that all others are to be excluded.\nCorollary: Deduction that needs no proof.\nThe question then is: Who are comprehended within the phrase \"free white persons\"? Undoubtedly the word \"free\" was originally used in recognition of the fact that slavery then existed and that some white persons occupied that status. The word, however, has long since ceased to have any practical significance and may now be disregarded.\nWe have been furnished with elaborate briefs in which the meaning of the words \"white person\" is discussed with ability and at length, both from the standpoint of judicial decision and from that of the science of ethnology. It does not seem to us necessary, however, to follow counsel in their extensive researches in these fields. It is sufficient to note the fact that these decisions are, in substance, to the effect that the words import a racial and not an individual test, and with this conclusion, fortified as it is by reason and authority, we entirely agree. Manifestly the test afforded by the mere color of the skin of each individual is impracticable , as that differs greatly among persons of the same race, even among Anglo-Saxons , ranging by imperceptible gradations from the fair blond to the swarthy brunette, the latter being darker than many of the lighter hued persons of the brown or yellow races. Hence to adopt the color test alone would result in a confused overlapping of races and a gradual merging of one into the other, without any practical line of separation\u2026. Moreover, that conclusion has become so well established by judicial and executive concurrence and legislative acquiescence that we should not at this late day feel at liberty to disturb it, in the absence of reasons far more cogent than any that have been suggested\u2026. The determination that the words \"white person\" are synonymous with the words \"a person of the Caucasian race\" simplifies the problem, although it does not entirely dispose of it. Controversies have arisen and will no doubt arise again in respect of the proper classification of individuals in border line cases. The effect of the conclusion that the words \"white person\" means a Caucasian is not to establish a sharp line of demarcation between those who are entitled and those who are not entitled to naturalization, but rather a zone of more or less debatable ground outside of which, upon the one hand, are those clearly eligible, and outside of which, upon the other hand, are those clearly ineligiblefor citizenship. Individual cases falling within this zone must be determined as they arise from time to time by what this court has called, in another connection \u2026, \"the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.\"\nImpracticable: Incapable of being accomplished.\nAnglo-Saxons: Descendants of the Germanic peoples who conquered England in the fifth century c.e., in this case referring to white non-Jews.\nImperceptible gradations: Gradual stages barely capable of being seen.\nJudicial and executive concurrence: Agreement between courts of justice and the executive branch of government.\nLegislative acquiescence: Acceptance by those who make laws.\nCaucasian: Of or relating to the white race.\nThe briefs filed on behalf of appellant refer in complimentary terms to the culture and enlightenment of the Japanese people, and with this estimate we have no reason to disagree; but these are matters which cannot enter into our consideration of the questions here at issue. We have no function in the matter other than to ascertain the will of Congress and declare it. Of course there is not implied\u2014either in the legislation or in our interpretation of it\u2014any suggestion of individual unworthiness or racial inferiority. These considerations are in no manner involved\u2026.\nBriefs: Legal documents outlining the facts and points in a case.\nTwo years after the Ozawa case, the Supreme Court ruled in another case (United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind) involving a man described as \"a high-caste Hindu, of full Indian blood, born at Amritsar, Punjab, India\" who had applied for citizenship, arguing that he was \"Caucasian.\" In the Ozawa case, the Court ruled that the word \"white\" did not really refer to skin color (since many people have lighter or darker skins), but rather to the \"Caucasian\" race. But in the Thind case, the Court took the opposite approach: Thind might be Caucasian, in a scientific sense, but in a popular sense, his skin was too dark to qualify as \"white,\" and therefore he was not eligible to become a citizen, the court ruled. \"It may be true,\" wrote U.S. Supreme Court justice George Sutherland (1862\u20131942), \"that the blond Scandinavian and the brown Hindu have a common ancestor in the dim reaches of antiquity, but the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences between them today; and it is not impossible, if that common ancestor could be materialized in the flesh, we should discover that he was himself sufficiently differentiated from both of his descendants to preclude his racial classification with either.\" In other words, the \"average man\" knows a \"white\" person when he sees one, even if lawyers and scientists cannot agree on what the term means. It was a startling admission that the concept of race and skin color, applied to immigration law, had no real meaning beyond what the \"average man\" might think at any given moment.\nIn 1924, Congress took another approach to limiting immigration. The Immigration Act of 1924 set permanent limits on the number of immigrants from each country. From 1924 through 1927, the number of immigrants from any one country was set at 2 percent of the number of foreign-born people of that nationality already in the United States in 1890. After July 1, 1927, the limits on each nationality were determined by a more complicated formula calculated by determining what percentage of the total population was represented by each national group, then multiplying that percentage by 150,000. Thus, if nationality \"A\" represented 1 percent of the U.S. population in 1890, the number of immigrants of nationality \"A\" admitted each year would equal 1 percent of 150,000, or 1,500 people. The practical effect of the 1924 law was to limit severely the number of immigrants after 1924, especially immigrants from non-European countries. The law also included a provision that barred anyone from immigrating who was not eligible to become a citizen. This provision was specifically aimed at Japanese immigrants and was at least partly based on the Ozawa decision of the Supreme Court.\nThe Ozawa case was just one of several examples of how racial consciousness played a large role in American politics during the 1920s. The year before the decision was handed down by the Supreme Court, Congress had passed the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, which limited immigration from any single country to a number equal to 3 percent of the number of immigrants of that country who were living in the United States in 1910.\nThe Ku Klux Klan was a secret organization that first appeared after the American Civil War (1861\u201365) as a means of terrorizing newly freed African American slaves and discouraging them from exercising their right to vote. Members of the original Klan wore long, white robes with a tall, peaked hood. They often burned crosses near African American neighborhoods at night as a means of frightening black people. In 1915, a new organization had been formed, using the same name as the Klan and the same costumes. The second version, however, was more open in its membership. Rather than being limited to the southern states, like the first Klan, the reborn Klan found many members in states of the Midwest, particularly Indiana. Although the second Klan still burned crosses, it also took on the form of a social club. Many elected politicians, including future president Harry S. Truman (1884\u20131972; served 1945\u201353), admitted to belonging to the Klan for a time. Whereas the first Klan had aimed its attacks at newly freed slaves, the second Klan attracted people opposed not only to racial minorities but also to Catholics, Jews, and immigrants from southern Europe (many of whom were also Catholic). Inside organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, racial prejudice and religious prejudice went hand in hand.\nGeorge Sutherland, the Supreme Court justice who wrote the opinion in Ozawa v. United States, was himself an immigrant. Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire, England, and brought to the United States as a baby. His family settled in what was then Utah Territory, which be came a state in 1896. Sutherland, a Republican, was Utah's sole U.S. representative from 1901 to 1903 and a U.S. senator from 1905 to 1917. He was nominated for the Supreme Court by President Warren Harding (1860\u20131924; served 1921\u201324) on September 5, 1922, and confirmed by the Senate on the same day. He had been a Supreme Court justice for just a month when the Ozawa case was argued, October 3\u20134, 1922. The case was decided one month later, on November 13, 1922.\nDudley, William, ed.

Usually an individual will have a couple of ticks on it though occasionally there are hedgehogs with heavier burdens. Ticks often attach themselves to the underside, behind the ears or the flanks of hedgehogs but they can occur elsewhere as well. Ticks are in general harmless to hedgehogs. However, a high parasite load can be indicative of sickness.\nHedgehogs often get ringworm, with around a quarter of the national population thought to be affected. Most hedgehogs show no visible symptoms and even those with severe infections can still show little sign of skin infection and can feed normally. Dry, crusty ears are one of the most common symptoms of a ringworm infection.\n\u2192 What do I do if I\u2019ve seen a dead or diseased hedgehog?"}

The main rule declared all knights equal among themselves, united in a military and religious \u2018fraternity.\u2019 This is probably why the Order has only one rank. All the Knights had an equal say in the decisions concerning the admission of new members, who were elected unanimously.\nAt its inception, the Order had fifteen knights. In 1409, Amadeus VIII (1383-1451), Count of Savoy, later elevated to the first Duke of Savoy in 1416, gave the Order its first known statutes. In 1518, Amadeus VIII\u2019s statutes were amended and reformed by Duke Charles III (1486-1553) who extended the Order to five more knights. Further amendments were made in 1570 by Duke Emmanuel Philibert (1528-1580), and thereafter by succeeding Grand Masters. The most recent changes were promulgated on June 11, 1985 by H.R.H. Prince Victor Emmanuel of Savoy, the current hereditary Grand Master of the Order.\u200b The head of the Royal House of Savoy continues to confer the Order, though very rarely. A recent recipient was H.S.H. the late Prince Rainier III of Monaco. The Annunziata is now bestowed only upon members of royal families and heads of state. Today, in addition to senior members of the Savoy family, its members also include H.M. the King of Spain, H.M. the King of The Belgians, and H.I.M. the Emperor of Japan.\n\u200b\u200bThe Order has only one rank and is limited to twenty knights. The first insignia was a goldplated silver collar with the motto, fert, inside a ring with three Savoy knots. The Order, however, has two sets of insignia, the Piccola Collana (Small Collar) and the Grande Collana (Large Collar). The primary and oldest insignia of the Annunziata is the collar. It consists of a solid gold medallion of the collar, which portrays the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary by the Archangel Gabriel. The medallion is surrounded by three intertwined Savoy knots, decorated with small crosses fleury, and in the upper center, between two of the Savoy knots, a cluster of rays with a dove, representing the Holy Spirit, is also depicted in gold. The badge is suspended from a gold chain made up of fifteen ornate gold sections, each of which is linked by a Savoy knot. The star of the Annunziata, which was first used in 1680 is gold and also has a representation of the Annunciation in a medallion in the center which is set within a gold cross of four pommels. This is surrounded by a cluster of gold rays."}

By scanning electron microscopy and image analysis, the mean orientation of mineral platelets at the osteoblastic\u2013osteocyte lacuna (Ot.Lc) floor was found to be 19\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 in the tibia and 20\u00b0 \u00b1 14\u00b0 in the femur. Further, the mineral platelets showed a high degree of directional coherency: 37 \u00b1 7 % in the tibia and 38 \u00b1 9 % in the femur. The majority of Ot.Lc in the tibia (69.37 %) and the femur (74.77 %) exhibited a mean orientation of mineral platelets between 0\u00b0 and 25\u00b0, with the largest fraction within a 15\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 range, 17.12 and 19.8 % in the tibia and femur, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise the features observed on the anorganic bone surface. The Ca/P (atomic %) ratio was 1.69 \u00b1 0.1 within the Ot.Lc and 1.68 \u00b1 0.1 externally. Raman spectra of NaOCl-treated bone showed peaks associated with carbonated apatite: \u03bd1, \u03bd2 and \u03bd4 PO4 3\u2212, and \u03bd1 CO3 2\u2212, while the collagen amide bands were greatly reduced in intensity compared to untreated bone. The apatite-to-collagen ratio increased considerably after deproteinisation; however, the mineral crystallinity and the carbonate-to-phosphate ratios were unaffected. The ~19\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 orientation of mineral platelets in at the Ot.Lc floor may be attributable to a gradual rotation of osteoblasts in successive layers relative to the underlying surface, giving rise to the twisted plywood-like pattern of lamellar bone.\nThe online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s00223-015-0072-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorised users.\nThis study was supported by the Swedish Research Council (Grant K2015-52X-09495-28-4), the BIOMATCELL VINN Excellence Center of Biomaterials and Cell Therapy, the Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, an ALF/LUA Grant, the IngaBritt and Arne Lundberg Foundation, the Dr. Felix Neubergh Foundation, Promobilia, the Hjalmar Svensson Foundation, and the Materials Science Area of Advance at Chalmers and the Department of Biomaterials, University of Gothenburg.\nFurqan A.

The E. coli bacteria normally present in the appendix start invading the wall of the appendix causing acute inflammation. Pus begins to form in this closed off space (called an abscess) leading to rapid deterioration. The jordans for sale inflamed wall of the appendix produces an inflammatory secretion that is under pressure. These factors make it possible that within only a few hours there can be a rupture of the appendix and a spread of infection into the abdominal cavity (peritonitis).\nOnce the pus is pouring into the abdominal cavity, all of the bacteria flow with it into the space between the bowels and the back of the abdominal cavity. Bacteria can very quickly invade the blood stream and cause a dangerous form of blood infection nfl jerseys cheap (septicemia).\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of appendicitis.\nThe diagnosis of appendicitis is clinical with the physician relying heavily on physical examination to identify tenderness in the right lower abdomen and rebound tenderness (when the examining hand suddenly lets go of the pressure). A rectal examination, depending on the location of the appendix, will show tenderness as well.\nOther diagnostic tests include blood tests and urinalysis (used to rule out kidney stones or cheap nba jerseys urinary tract infection). In the acute appendicitis case there is no room for CT scans and ultrasounds, but in a complex perforated case with abscesses this may be done prior to surgery.\nOnce the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis has been made, surgery needs to be arranged as soon as possible. Patients can be placed under general anaesthesia if they have fasted for 6 hours prior. Keeping this in mind it is important to keep a person that consumptie-laboratorium is brought to the hospital for abdominal pain away from food and drink to help reduce the delay in being admitted for surgery.\nThe surgeon will decide whether to remove the fake oakleys appendix through a stabbing wound (laparoscopic appendectomy) or through a 1- to 2-inch incision (appendectomy). The surgery will take only 45 minutes in a straightforward case, but can be 2 hours for a complex perforation.

{"id": 66, "text": "Constant development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) technologies results in evolving aircraft, instrumentation, and control programs of these systems. An open source simulator was examined as a potential method of testing UAS platforms changes. The open source simulator was used to simulate flights flown by an actual platform. Existing flight data was used as a base line of comparison for the telemetry data of the simulated flight. Patterns in parameters such as vehicle attitude and throttle output were compared between the simulated and actual results to determine if the simulator produced an accurate representation of a physical flight. Analysis of the simulated vehicle exhibited similar behavior to that of the actual vehicle in most of the flight data collected. Simplification in the flight simulator model may be responsible for the deviations in magnitude observed between the two sets of data. Three points of interest in each of the three test cases were chosen as checks for the values in the data. These points in the flight were studied in the various graphs of the parameters graphed and the difference between the simulated and actual values was calculated. The values at these points stayed within an average of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for vehicle attitude and between 0% and 33.3% throttle difference over the three test cases. The average difference in attitude was 5.1\u00b0 over 93 compared values and 8.1% in throttle over 18 compared values. On average the simulator showed good agreement to existing flight data and therefore will be a good tool to simulate flights prior to a mission. The accuracy of the results may be improved with further development of the simulation model.\nRamirez Duarte, Jaime A.

{"id": 1546, "text": "Psoriasis, a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin disorder. The most common type, called plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), is characterized by slightly elevated reddish patches or papules (solid elevations) covered with silvery white scales. In most cases, the lesions tend to be symmetrically distributed on the elbows and knees, scalp, chest, and buttocks. The lesions may remain small and solitary or coalesce into large plaques that often form geometrical patterns with a central area of normal skin. In many cases the nails become thickened, irregularly laminated, and brittle. In addition to plaque psoriasis, there are four other types of psoriasis, including guttate, pustular, inverse (or flexular), and erythrodermic.\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated (or autoimmune) disorder that occurs when immune cells known as T lymphocytes, or T cells, attack healthy skin cells in both the nonvascular horny outer layer of the skin and its deeper vascular layer. This attack causes the life span of the skin cells to shorten to about 3 to 5 days (skin cells normally live about 20 to 28 days) and forces the cells to reproduce more rapidly than normal. Psoriasis occurs in both sexes with equal frequency, being most prevalent between the ages of 10 and 30. It is most often seen in northern climates. An estimated 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population is affected by psoriasis. In contrast, between 0.05 and 0.3 percent of Asians experience the condition. In European countries the incidence of psoriasis is highly variable, affecting anywhere from less than 1 percent to more than 6 percent of populations.\nThe onset of psoriasis is usually gradual but occasionally explosive. Precipitating factors may include injury to the skin, acute infection, and psychological upsets. Ordinarily, the lesions become less severe and sometimes disappear during the summer, possibly owing to the effect of sunlight. The severe complications of psoriasis are extensive sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, with resulting inflammation, and psoriatic arthritis. Generally, however, individuals with psoriasis are in relatively good health. The variability in the progression and severity of the disorder has led researchers to suspect that the underlying causes of psoriasis are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is no permanent cure for psoriasis, but there are a variety of treatments aimed at relieving the associated skin symptoms. Topical treatments for psoriasis come in different forms (e.g., creams and gels) and generally provide relief from inflammation and scaling. Some, such as retinoids (derivatives of vitamin A) and synthetic forms of vitamin D, work by slowing skin cell reproduction, whereas others, such as corticosteroids, coal-tar ointment, and salicylic acid, work by reducing inflammation. Psoriasis can also be treated with phototherapy, in which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light. While phototherapy can be highly effective, it does have side effects, including pain, irregular pigmentation, and scarring. In addition, long-term treatments are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.\nOral medications are available to treat psoriasis but are often used as a last resort, because the drugs that are most effective in treating psoriasis suppress the immune system, making patients susceptible to a multitude of infections and illnesses that can be life-threatening. Oral drugs that are used to reduce inflammation include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. Oral drugs called biologics (because they are made from human or animal proteins) modulate the immune system by attacking immune cells that are working improperly. Several biologics have been approved for psoriasis, including infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), and guselkumab (Tremfya)."}

Augusta is known for the Masters, but there are several other fascinating sides to this city. Here are five things you never knew about Augusta, home of the Masters.\nAugusta was Georgia\u2019s capital briefly during the American Revolution and then again from 1785 until 1795. In 1788, the Georgia state convention ratified the U.S. Constitution in the city. Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the Constitution and the first in the Deep South. Augusta wasn\u2019t chartered as a city until 1798, so it was actually Georgia\u2019s capital city before officially becoming a city itself.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, who was in office from 1913 to 1921, was born in Virginia but grew up in Augusta. Born in 1856, Wilson lived in Augusta from 1858 to 1870. His father was the pastor of Augusta\u2019s First Presbyterian Church and his family owned a beautiful manse on Seventh Street. Wilson spent the \u201cformative years of his life\u201d in the city. He lived in Augusta during the Civil War and the Reconstruction before going to college in North Carolina. Today, you can visit his boyhood home, which is a National Historic Landmark and the oldest Presidential residence in the state. Guided tours begin on the hour every Thursday through Saturday.\nAugusta has been either the hometown or burial place of 10 Confederate generals \u2014 Brig. Gen. Edward P. Alexander, Maj. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright and Gen. Marcellus A. Stovall, among others. \u201cWhen the South needed generals during the Civil War, it often turned to Augustans,\u201d the Augusta Chronicle says. Today, you can see monuments all over the city that have been dedicated to these men.\nThe Masters wasn\u2019t always called the Masters; the title didn\u2019t come about until 1939. The tournament began in 1934 and was originally known as the Augusta National Invitational. That name didn\u2019t sound quite prestigious enough, however \u2014 so in 1939, the name was changed to the Masters.\nThe first-in-flight brothers from North Carolina brought their airplanes to Georgia. The Wright Flying School was in business from 1910 to 1916. During that time, it taught 119 people to fly Wright airplanes. The main location of the school was in Alabama and then moved to Ohio. Trying to take advantage of the warm winters in the South, the Wrights also opened a seasonal facility in Augusta in 1911. It was run by Frank Coffyn, an aviator who was a member of the Wright Exhibition Team after the Wright brothers taught him to fly."}

Female Balb/c mice were exposed to cigarette smoke prior to mating, during gestation and lactation. Male offspring were studied at postnatal day (P) 1, P20 and 13 weeks (W13). SE dams had reduced inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and toll like receptor (TLR)4 mRNA), antioxidant (manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)), and increased mitochondrial activities (OXPHOS-I, III and V) and protein damage marker nitrotyrosine. Brain hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1\u03b1 and its upstream signalling molecule early growth response factor (EGR)1 were not changed in the SE dams. In the SE offspring, brain IL-1R, IL-6 and TLR4 mRNA were increased at W13. The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane, and MnSOD were reduced at W13 with higher nitrotyrosine staining. HIF-1\u03b1 was also increased at W13, although EGR1 was only reduced at P1. In conclusion, maternal SE increased markers of hypoxia and oxidative stress with mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage in both dams and offspring, and upregulated inflammatory markers in offspring, which may render SE dams and their offspring vulnerable to additional brain insults."}

Doctors should be attuned to differentials and patients should voice concerns over unexplained symptoms\u2014perhaps insisting on accurate testing rather than empirical evaluations.\nLymphoma is a cancer of the lymphocytes (white blood cells) that typically play a key role in fighting infection. The lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system, comprising a network of conduits called lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph towards the heart. Collections of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymphatic tissue is also located in other parts of the body, including the stomach, skin, and small intestine. A multidisciplinary approach is useful to optimally manage patients with rare or complex neoplasms.\nThere are two broad types of lymphoma\u2014Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and many subclassifications. The main difference between HL and NHL is in the specific lymphocyte each involves. Because of so many variations, it is not uncommon for medical practitioners to offer differing diagnosis for the same symptoms or even lab results. In fact, a second opinion of pathologist biopsy interpretation (whether negative or positive) may be equally, if not more, important than a second opinion for an oncologist\u2019s treatment plan. Differences between malignant and benign cells can be subtle and interpretations can be subjective.\nPeople with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nDry eyes and aching joints can be precursors to lymphoma since people with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop NHL.

Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) lymphoma affects lymphatic tissue in parts of the body such as the stomach, gut, lungs and eyes. This B-cell lymphoma can, therefore, manifest dry eyes as secondary symptom.\nIn the United States, B-cell lymphomas (lymphocytes originating from bone marrow) account for about 85% of non-hodgkin lymphomas. The most common type is diffuse large B\u2011cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with average onset of 63-66 years of age. It is distinguished as a quickly growing mass within a lymph node.\nTherapeutic targets for diffuse large B\u2011cell lymphoma include RelA NF-\u03baB and IRAK4 Kinase.\nPrimary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) accounts for only 2% of all lymphomas. It is more prevalent among women in their 30s. PMBCL is similar to DLBCL but with fibrosis and generally localized in the middle of the chest. Both types respond well to treatment. Intravascular large B\u2011cell lymphoma is a rare subtype of DLBCL affecting blood vessels.\nThough most lymphomas manifest within internal organs, cutaneous T\u2011cell lymphomas (skin lymphoma or mycosis fungoides) can be observed externally. The problem with diagnosis is that there is great variation in appearance. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is not a disease but rather an inflam\u00admatory response to known or unknown stimuli that results in a lymphomatous-appearing but benign accumulation of inflam\u00admatory cells. Pseudolymphomas often show broad patches and plaques. They often mimic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Examples include actinic reticuloid, lymphoma\u00adtoid contact dermatitis, and lymphoma\u00adtoid drug eruptions.\nMycosis fungoides (MF) makes up 72% of CTCL. Sezary syndrome is an advanced, variant form of MF, which is characterized by the presence of lymphoma cells in the blood. Extensive thin, red, itchy rashes usually cover over 80% of the body in MF.\nClassic MF primarily arises in the double-clothed areas of the body: axillae, breasts, groin, and buttock primarily presented with thin, red, scaly, poorly demarcated plaques of at least 5cm in diameter. Over time the morphology tends toward thickening of the plaques to more erythematous prominence, and, of course, tumors that may ulcerate. Early MF can be subtle and usually lacks classic histopathologic signs, therein causing so much trouble for making the early definitive diagnosis. This is why I do not rely solely on pathology to confirm early-stage disease.\nSlow growing lymphomas have the best early cure rate. The dichotomy is that they are generally discovered after disease has progressed to an advanced stage. High-grade aggressive lymphomas are often symptomatic early on and are potentially curable with aggressive treatments.\nPain is not a primary symptom. Skin lesions that do not heal, deep or surface lumps in the neck, armpits, chest, breasts, abdomen or groin should be brought to the attention of appro\u00adpriate medical professionals. Diagnosis may involve a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and/or surgical biopsy of a swollen lymph node or bone marrow collection to determine A or B category of four progressive stages.  It is estimated that 9,290 men and women (5,070 men and 4,220 women) were diag\u00adnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2013.  Acording to the American Cancer Society, about 74,680 people, including children, (41,730 males and 32,950 females) will be diag\u00adnosed with NHL this year."}

In this generation of animals, 24% were lymphopenic with decreased numbers of PBL expressing CD5, TCR\u03b1, and RT6. The PBL of the lymphopenic animals had a decreased mitogenic response to ConA. All of the nonlymphopenic animals were homozygous for RT6.2. Phenotypic analysis of intestinal IEL revealed that this was also the case for the lymphopenic animals. Moreover, IEL of the lymphopenic animals exhibited a pattern of staining (increased numbers of TCR\u03b1\u03b2+CD4+CD8+ and decreased numbers of TCR\u03b1\u03b2+CD4\u2212CD8+) similar to that of BB DP animals. The ACI.1U(BB)-lymphopenic animals, although having two of the genetic traits associated with the expression of spontaneous diabetes mellitus, uniformly fail to develop diabetes.

{"id": 2023, "text": "Any speed over the speed of sound, which is approximately 343 m/s, 1,087 ft/s, 761 mph or 1,225 km/h in air at sea level, is said to be supersonic. Speeds greater than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes referred to as hypersonic.\nSound can be considered simply as a plane pressure disturbance in an elastic medium. As such sound will travel at different speeds in different mediums, mostly depending on the molecular mass and temperature of the medium in which the sound propagates; pressure has a very much smaller effect. Since air temperature and composition varies significantly with altitude, supersonic speeds for aircraft are given at sea level. In water at room temperature supersonic can be considered as any speed greater than 1,440 m/s or 4,724 ft/s.\nMany modern fighter aircraft are supersonic. The Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144 were supersonic passenger aircraft. But, since Concorde's final retirement flight on November 26 2003, there are no supersonic passenger aircraft left in service.\nMost modern firearm munitions are supersonic, with rifle projectile often travelling at speeds approaching Mach 3.\nIn 1942 the United Kingdom's Ministry of Aviation began a top secret project with the Miles Aircraft to develop the world's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier. The project resulted in the development of the prototype Miles M.52 aircraft, which was designed to reach 1000 mph (1600 km/h) at 36,000 feet (11 km) in 1 minute 30 seconds.\nThe aircraft's design was revolutionary introducing many innovations which are still used on today's supersonic aircraft. The single most important development was the all-moving tailplane which allowed control to be maintained at supersonic speeds; this was the brainchild of Dennis Bancroft and his team at Miles Research. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled by the Director of Scientific Research, Sir Ben Lockspeiser, before any manned fights were conducted. Subsequently, on government orders, all design data and research regarding the Miles M.52 was sent to BELL aircraft in the USA. There was supposed to be data exchange in both directions, but allegedly, after receiving the British data, the American government blocked the deal.\nLater experimentation on the Miles M.52 design proved that the aircraft would indeed have broken the sound barrier, with an unmanned 3/10 scale replica of the M.52 achieving Mach 1.5 in October 1948.\nChuck Yeager was the first man to break the sound barrier in level flight on October 14 1947, flying the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach 1 at an altitude of 45,000 feet (13.7 km).\nA team led by Richard Noble and driver Andy Green became the first to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle, called the Thrust SuperSonicCar, on October 15 1997, almost exactly 50 years after Yeager's flight.\nHans Guido Mutke claimed to have broken the sound barrier before Yeager, on April 9 1945 in a Messerschmitt Me 262. However, this claim is disputed by most experts and lacks a scientific foundation.\nSupersonic aerodynamics are simpler than subsonic ones because the airsheets at different points along the plane doesn't know of each other. Subsonic air anticipates an airplane or an airfoil, supersonic air just jams into the shock-wave.\nOne can gently guide air around the fuselage of the aircraft without producing new shockwave, but any change in cross area further down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body.\nIt should be kept in mind, however, that the aerodynamic principles behind a supersonic aircraft are often more complex than described above due to the fact that such an aircraft must be efficient and stable at both supersonic, transonic and subsonic flight.\nThis page was last modified 08:56, 23 Jun 2005."}

Dry skin can also result from underlying medical conditions.\nDermatitisis the medical term for extremely dry skin. There are several different types of dermatitis.\nContact dermatitis develops when your skin reacts to something it touches, causing localized inflammation.\nIrritant contact dermatitis can occur when your skin\u2019s exposed to an irritating chemical agent, such as bleach.\nAllergic contact dermatitis can develop when your skin is exposed to a substance you\u2019re allergic to, such as nickel.\nSeborrheic dermatitisoccurs when your skin produces too much oil. It results in a red and scaly rash, usually on your scalp. This type of dermatitis is common in infants.\nAtopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. It\u2019s a chronic skin condition that causes dry scaly patches to appear on your skin. It\u2019s common among young children.\nOther conditions, such as psoriasis and type 2 diabetes, can also cause your skin to dry out.\nAge. Older adults are more likely to develop dry skin.

Along with lifestyle remedies, they may recommend over-the-counter or prescription ointments, creams, or lotions to treat your symptoms.\nIt\u2019s also important to choose the right kind of moisturizer for your skin type. If your skin is extremely dry, look for a petrolatum-based product.\nYou might consider switching to a lighter, water-based lotion during the summer months if your skin becomes less dry then. Lotions that contain grapeseed oil and antioxidants can also help trap water in your skin.\nIf you experience occasional dry skin, you can likely prevent and treat it using simple lifestyle changes and over-the-counter moisturizers.

{"id": 4400, "text": "Why is the Coptic Pope based in Cairo and not Alexandria?\nShouldn't the Coptic Pope be based in Alexandria, seeing as we call the His Holiness the Pope of \"Alexandria\"? And the Coptic Church is called the Church of \"Alexandria\"? I know there exists the Historical Cathedral of St. Mark in Alexandria but why is the Pope based in the Cathedral in Cairo?\nWhy and when did this change occur?\nThe change as made when Cairo became the capital of Egypt. As for when was it done, i'll leave that to someone else to find.\nCairo was built in second half of the 10th century, by the Fatimite Khalif El-Muez LeDin Allah (later baptized in the monastery of Abu Seifen after the Mukatam miracle).\nIt was built in place of existing \"cities\" like El-Fustat and El-Kata'3, which were more of camping sites of the islamic armies and the residence place of the arab rulers, and had been the center of political power since the arab invasion.\nCairo became the capital of the Fatimite State in North Africa and the Levant and as such of increasing political importance, which led the 70th Pope Gabriel II (known as Ibn Turek) to officially annex Cairo to Alexandria under his jurisdiction in his papacy (1131 -1145 a.d.). Pope Gabriel II annexed Cairo after the death of her Bishop, Youaness Ibn Senhout.\nThere are indications that Pope Gabriel II was not the first Pope to try to move to Cairo, but he was the first successful Pope in his attempt.\nThe residence of all subsequent Popes has been a church in Cairo.\nInterestingly enough, the famous theologian and Bishop Boulous El-Boushy in the 13th century, is sometimes referred to as Bishop of Cairo (Egypt) or Babylon (the ancient fortress near Cairo). It is not known whether Babylon was considered outside the geographic limits of diocese of Cairo, but is not likely. It is equally unlikely that Pope Kyrillos III would give up any territory to another bishop, even if it his close friend.\nThe same is with patriarch of Serbia.\nIn middle ages his see was town of Pec but when the Turks invaded Serbia after several centuries the see was moved. And that happend two times.\nNow Serbian patriarch in his title has that he is archbishop of Pec, but he resides 500km north, in Belgrade.\nSeveral dioceses of Serbian church also in their name has one see, but bishop resides in another.\nI believe the Pope is stretched too thin. Covering Cairo, Alexandria, all the areas in the States without a diocesan Bishop seems to be too much. It would seem very difficult if not impossible to provide effective oversight with such a wide span of control.\nBut the pope is not alone. In the US, he has a patriarchal exarch for North America through Bishop David, a patriarchal exarch for the Eritreans in the US through Bishop Macarius, a suffragan diocese of Virgina through Bishop Michael, and 2 diocese with their respective bishops. He also has general bishops doing work in the US.\nIn Cairo, there are 12 general bishops who are either suffragan bishops or assistants to the patriarchal throne in Cairo. He also has a patriarchal vicar in Cairo through Hegumen Sergios Sergios.\n\"Stretched too thin\" is a very subjective quality. What exactly is too thin? Are 5 bishops in the US not enough that Pope Tawadros is doing the work himself? Praise God who sent us a shepherd with such vigor and enthusiasm and heart. May God give our pope the strength to do His will always, regardless of where the pope resides.\nComplex issues and decisions have still required the involvement of the Pope in some of the areas that you mention that are technically in the Pope's diocese but overseen by bishops.\nSometimes the bishops may even defer the issue entirely to the Pope and ask the church in question to take the issue up with the Pope directly. In the meantime the bishops may avoid visiting or contacting the church in question to avoid getting involved in a situation they feel should only be addressed by the Pope.\nHere is where situations can deteriorate. By the time a church is able to actually contact and communicate with the Pope, months if not years usually pass and situations can spiral out of control. A simple issue that could have been resolved with early intervention can be disastrous if left to fester. And this has happened more than once.\nHG Bishop Youssef and I believe HG Bishop Serapion visit each church in their diocese at least twice a year if not more and are in constant contact with priests and congregation. They are able to keep tabs on the churches in their diocese. They also have the authority to address issues and make decisions complex or otherwise. I am not so sure the churches in the areas you mention benefit from the same type of regular oversight and ability to sucessfully resolve problems swiftly.\nHH Pope Tawadros has shown wisdom in his managerial style and I am confident he will structure church leadership in a way that is most effective - not necessarily the way it was in the past. Just as HH Pope Shenouda showed wisdom in assigning diocesan bishops such as Bishop Serapion and Bishop Youssef, I am sure HH Pope Tawadros will continue to structure leadership effectively.\nI think people's issue is that these bishops are all general bishops, and so the Pope is the ultimate diocesan bishop. Since these general bishops cannot ordain their own priests and thus have their authority derived from the Pope, this effectively gives the Pope control over them, giving him control of the Holy Synod (he can count on the votes of the general bishops under his control), and thus moving towards a Roman Catholic monarchal model of the papacy. In ancient times, the bishop of Alexandria was first among equals in Egypt, and still only had one vote in the Synod. Now he effectively has the votes of 30 general bishops plus himself.\nNote: this is not personal, I am not saying that Pope Tawadros, or any other previous popes were wrong, I'm just saying that the principle is wrong.\nYou are right, but it is clear that this will be the hierarchy model for the foreseen future of the Coptic Church.\ni have to ask...what would those 'votes' of the general bishops count towards?! ya3ny isn't each of them STILL have their own voice and authority as a bishop in the holy synod. if each diocese only have one bishop vote int he Holy Synod....what about the dioceses that are being broken up more and more through the years as the congregation increases.....is that 'vote' broken up into little parts to?!\nTheoretically the general bishops have their own vote of course, but realistically and practically they are not going to go against the Pope, as he is their boss (you do what your boss tells you). It is unheard of until now for a bishop to have a boss.\nI don't get the second part of your statement. If dioceses are being broken up, it means that more diocesan bishops are being ordained, and I can see no reason why a full diocesan bishop shouldn't have a vote.\nso it's not that a bishop has a vote, it's a diocese bishop.....kool!!!\nActually, in regards to the magisterial model of the Catholic church, I actually heard Metropolitan Pachomious actually say that our church legislation was governed by the magesterium! I was extremely upset that because of the model of leadership which we have experienced, even the teaching of the church fathers has changed to a western ideology.\nI see exactly what you are saying but I think it will be different with HH Pope Tawadros. You see, Pope Shenouda ordained myriads of bishops, in some cases general bishops and in some cases he split up other dioceses. He typically ordained people who he knew that their line of thinking was more similar to the \"Sunday School movement.\" This is the first thing. Secondly, most Bishops whom he ordained were his children, or became his children, and felt a deep sense of duty/fidelity to him, not wanting to upset/diagree with him. So yes, Pope Shenouda's synod was clearly a magesterium, and as the head of the magesterium, he had control over the synod.\nAnd I also agree that general bishops should not be given a vote in the synod. Who are they representing? Themselves? Scripture and tradition in the Orthodox church have always grown out of community. But where is the community in Anba Labomba who takes care of the Pope's limousine having a vote in the synod? He represents no-one. If he does represent a group of people, why not just give him the diocese?\nThis is of course, my opinion.\nQawe, I think your statement is your opinion. But if you think it is fact then the burden of proof is on you to verify its veracity. Do you have any actual evidence that no general bishop would ever or has ever disagreed and voted against the Pope? Do you have any actual evidence that no diocese bishops has ever consistently voted with the pope simply because they did not want to disagree with the pope? You might be correct about general bishops. But we should avoid generalization without actual evidence.\nI agree with you that realistically, no one will publicly disagree and fight against the Pope. However, the Synod is neither setup as a pure democracy, nor a a tyrannical monarchal aristocracy. In a democracy, theoretically each person has equal weight in a vote and they are always free to express their views. A monarchal aristocracy, on the other hand, cares nothing for individual freedom. There is no voting in a monarchy. If it was, what's the point of voting at all? The same is true for the Synod. What is the point of voting, if all the bishops were not encouraged to express their views and opinions in ecclesiastical matters through their vote?\n(you do what your boss tells you).\nI own a business. I am the boss in my office. I can tell you for sure, I would fire an employee who is just a \"yes man\" and hire someone who has the confidence and courage to keep me inline for the wellness of the business. Any boss will tell you, unless you work in a crappy job that requires no thinking, no good business just wants to mindless employees. They want people who can increase production. They want a person who takes initiative, thinks for themselves and finds solutions (even if it is not what the boss normally expects).\nIt is unheard of until now for a bishop to have a boss.\nIs it unheard of that a bishop is part of a hierarchal system where he is equal among brothers yet all are servants to Christ? Has not Christ been the boss (called Master in liturgical and scriptural language) of all the bishops all along?\nEffective leadership brings many moving parts inline to one direction. The moving parts choose not to challenge their leader in every decision if there is positive results. The only ones who question a leader or a leader's system, are (1) those outside the system and (2) those who see negative results or failure. Are we outside the Synod's system or jurisdiction? Is the Synod failing in their job to shepherd Christ's people? Then why do we really care how general bishops vote?\nThank you Remnkemi for your non-polemical reply (not that I expected a polemical reply from you.\nHowever, the Synod is neither setup as a pure democracy, nor a a tyrannical monarchal aristocracy. In a democracy, theoretically each person has equal weight in a vote and they are always free to express their views.\nWhy should every bishop not have equal weight in a vote? Are they not equal?\nWhat is the point of voting, if all the bishops were not encouraged to express their views and opinions in ecclesiastical matters through their vote?\nAs a vestige of the past, when bishops were encouraged to express their views and opinions. There is no point in voting if there is a monarchal papacy.\nOf course Christ is the head of the church including the bishops. That is what I am arguing for, against what has happened in that we have moved towards the Roman Catholic model where the Pope is the Head of the Church, being Christ's representative on Earth.\nYou mention 'equal among brothers'. How are they equal if a general bishop cannot ordain priests?\nWhile the Pope is the leader, insofar as he is the chair of the Synod, he is not the decision maker, as is suggested in the bolded part of your post. As first among equals, his position is analogous to that of the See of Rome in the early Church. Thus, he is not their leader in the context of making decisions, such that an opposing opinion should be deemed a 'challenge'.\nYou are a lot more thoughtful and philosophical than me, so it is possible that I may have misunderstood some of your points. If so, please forgive me.\nQawe, sorry for the late response. Let's discuss this more.\nTheoretically, every bishop or every citizen of a governing body should have an equal vote. But no actual democratic system is setup this way. Why? Problems arise. Look at the US presidential process. Every American citizen over 18 is allowed to vote. But the President is not elected by popular votes. He is elected by the electoral college - who legally can vote against their respective popular vote. It has happened about 150 times in the past for many reasons. If the President was elected by popular vote only, a large state with many territories but few people will be counted as a small state with many people. So the founding fathers choose to construct a system whereby each state is represented by an electoral college, regardless of territory. This system makes some states more influential than others. Are not all states equal to the federal government? Yes, in honor but not in particular situations where blind equality would cause problems.\nI think the Synod has established a similar hierarchical system. All bishops are equal in honor but not in duties. The general bishop system was assumingly setup to avoid certain problems. Regardless of how fair or untraditional this general bishop system is, it is the system in place. It is still a \"democratic\" theocratic system (better than a lot of other systems out there). I understand many feel the system will inevitably transform into a theocratic electoral college like the Roman Catholic Church. Probably not. But even if it were to become reality, what is the harm if the system works? What is the harm if changing our system brings better results? If the Synod allows these changes, it must be for a good reason. I would go so far and say unless these changes result in heresy (which by definition is a failed system) it is the Holy Spirit who wants the changes.\nThis is assuming there is a monarchical system in place. During the nomination process, Bishop Paula interviewed then Bishop Tawadros and specifically wanted him to comment on this misconception. Pope Tawadros' response was along the lines of \"There is no competition. There is no 'my way or the highway.' The Pope is servant before he is master.\" (I'm paraphrasing a few interviews).\nSometimes bishops who discuss their dissatisfaction on certain matters will address it privately with the patriarch. If an amicable solution is not achieved in private, I think any bishop would vote against the majority if this said bishop had valid concerns (ie, pertaining to the specific issue of the vote). I think any bishop is encouraged to express his concerns. I think the majority of issues are resolved privately and when a vote is required in the synod, there is usually no disagreement. I may be naive, but I think this is what has routinely happened in the past.\nWhen Christ chose His disciples, he gave them all equal authority to loose and bind people's sin. There's the equality. However, Christ didn't let all 12 disciples lean on His chest. He gave all His disciples the power to see signs and wonders along with all the people, yet He chose three to see Him transfigured into light. There are so many examples of \"preceived favoritism\" which isn't favoritism at all. It's a foreshadowing of a hierarchical system of duties and glories. In 1 Corinthians 15, St Paul further stresses this \"unity with distinction\" in glory and duties. \"All flesh is not the same flesh [distinction], but there is one kind of flesh of men [unity], another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies [unity]; but the glory of the celestial is one [distinction], and the glory of the terrestrial is another [distinction].\" There is unity and distinction. Both celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies are both created bodies. But there is distinct glory for each. There is distinction because the role of each is needed in God's divine providence. This is what St Paul meant when he said, \"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.\" Again, a hierarchical system (in this case, a chronological hierarchy) is setup with a purpose. What is that purpose in this case? \"As we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man.\" The prior duty of earthly life is to lead to death which leads to spiritual eternal life. There is a distinction in duties.\nDoes this mean we are moving to a system where the Pope is the head of the Church? No. It will never happen in the Orthodox Church. But we should not discourage a system of solidarity with distinction because it is biblical and traditional.\nI didn't use the proper words to express my thoughts. My comments were not meant to imply the leader has exclusive decision making authority. Actually, the opposite is implied. Let me put it this way. Leadership by definition is a process where decisions are catalyzed into positive change and improvements. The leader brings about change. His authority as a leader, depending on the hierarchical system again, may or may not involve exclusive or absolute decision making. Most leaders, at least for corporations, simply propose an idea and the board of directors has the final authority for the decision. This leader may not even be part of the board but he is the catalyst that brings about the change. What I meant to focus on was effective leadership. If that leader is really, really effective the board will choose not to challenge the requested change. That doesn't mean the board relinquished decision making authority. It doesn't mean that a challenge to the proposed plan is seen as a challenge to authority. It doesn't mean that any opposing opinion is a challenge to the leader. It simply means the board of directors is so attuned with the leader that they always agree.\nThe bolded section excluded the first part of the sentence that confirms this line of thought: \"The moving parts choose not to challenge\". It doesn't mean the moving parts have lost their authority or that any opposition challenges the validity of the leader. The leader will always be the leader if he is effective in bringing positive improvements.\nI am the least of all of you. I come here to learn from all of you. There is no need to apologize for constructive criticism and open discussion.\nMy prayers are for our church and leadership that it continues in peace delivering us to Christ through the Holy Spirit."}

This study aimed to investigate task-dependent changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) within the spinal cord during painful stimulation. Summary of Background Data. Earlier experiments by Mandl et al (2008, 2013) used non-invasive functional diffusion tensor imaging (fDTI) to detect white matter fibers that were active during functional tasks. In two studies, it was observed that FA of involved white matter tracts exhibited repeatable task-related increases. In this study, we attempted to extend the fDTI work in the spinal cord. Methods. Twenty-three healthy, right-handed men (mean age 22 yrs, standard deviation [SD]=4) were invited to participate in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were collected over spinal levels C2 to T4 during a painful thermal stimulus applied to the left thenar eminence. In order to investigate task-related activity, FA values within the contralateral (right) spinothalamic tract were analyzed using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) procedure. As a control, we also examined activity in the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts, which are not considered to be involved in nociception. Results. Significant task-related decreases in FA were observed in the right spinothalamic tract at vertebral levels C2-C5 (Wald X 2 (1)=17.754, P<0.001). There was no change in control regions at levels C7-T2 of the same tract, which are located below the level of input from dermatome C6, Wald X 2 (1)=0.185, P=0.667. Results in all other regions assessed, that is, the left spinothalamic tract and bilateral corticospinal tract, were also not significant (P>0.05). Conclusion. The current findings suggest that task-related changes in FA associated with the transmission of pain signals along the spinal cord can be detected using fDTI. We observed decreased FA values in the contralateral (right) spinothalamic tract following painful stimulation, while no such activity was apparent in control regions."}

If the particles in the flow stream are larger than the pores or openings in the filter medium, they will be removed as a result of direct interception by the holes.\nParticles in the air stream have mass and velocity, as the air stream passes through a filter media, the air diverts around the fiber, however because the particles tend to move in a straight line, those particles located at or near the center of the flow line will stick or impact upon the fiber and be removed.\nIn this process, particles are on a collision course with flow stream molecules. These frequent collisions cause the suspended particles to move in a random fashion around the fluid flow lines, which increases the likelihood of contacting the fiber surface and being removed.\nSieving is a simple technique for separating particles of different sizes. For example when a particle is too large to fit between the media fiber spaces."}

Compunction is constructive if it leads to confession, repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation, justification, and sanctification.\nAs in a court of law, confession means admitting that you\u2019ve done something wrong, or that your values were leading you down the wrong path of conduct. When you \u201cconfess that Jesus is Lord,\u201d you admit that you didn\u2019t recognize Jesus\u2019 authority and did not obey His commands.\nJust as in court, confession is something you say out loud. You can confess sins to a mature Christian, a pastor, a counselor, or to God in prayer. Before you confess to a human being, make sure they have the training and credentials to deal with the issue you are confessing.\nIn the ancient church, catechumens were required to stand on a box in front of everyone and confess their sins to the the entire congregation. This eventually ran into practical problems, because a convert\u2019s confession could implicate other people, especially if the convert were a government official. Since we are not supposed to confess other people\u2019s sins, catechumens were given the option of confessing to a clergyman privately. Confessing to clergy began as an option in the fourth century, then gradually became the norm.\nToday, confession is a church rite that some churches consider a sacrament. Confession to clergy is still the practice among Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, and Catholic Christians, though among Anglicans and Lutherans, it is optional.\nA dedication ceremony that sets people or objects aside for a holy purpose. A church can consecrate buildings, furniture, crosses, candlesticks and so on, or it can consecrate people for a holy purpose, such as lay reader or missionary. Consecration can be for a limited period of time, such as a person\u2019s term of office, and it usually has a limited scope, such as for reading scriptures publicly. The inner nature of the object or person being consecrated is not changed. The only thing that changes is an object\u2019s function or a person\u2019s tasks. See also sanctification and ordination.\nDeep sorrow for having done wrong. Contrition is constructive if it leads to confession, repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation, justification, and sanctification.\nThe word communicate originally meant to take Communion. People who are excommunicated are barred from Communion for disciplinary reasons, but may still participate in other parts of the service. In the ancient church, excommunicated people had to start over as catechumens, and after they completed the process, they were welcomed back to Communion.\nThe unilateral act of a creditor who cancels a debt, notifying the debtor that repayment is no longer necessary. Theologically, forgiveness cancels the guilt but not the consequence of the sin. If you are forgiven for robbing a bank, you still have to give the money back.\nFree will is a person\u2019s capacity to freely chose to repent and be saved. All branches of the historic Church affirm that we have free will, except theological traditions that are heavily influenced by Augustine\u2019s later writings. Those who deny free argue that it impugns God\u2019s sovereignty. The rest of the Church disagrees, observing that scriptures tell us to choose and to obey, two things we cannot possibly do without free will.\nGod\u2019s unmerited love and favor toward sinners, the divine gift that brings about contrition, penitence, repentance, and the works of obedience in response to forgiveness.\nA legal term that is often used instead of compunction. The word guilt has the unfortunate implication of a hopeless situation, so it is better to use the terms compunction or contrition in a theological setting. Feelings of guilt are only constructive if they lead to repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation, justification, and sanctification.\nThe place where the stars and planets are located, as in Matthew 24:29. We use heaven in this sense when we talk about the grandeur of the \u201cheavens\u201d while looking at the nighttime sky.\nThe place where God abides with His angels, as in Matthew 3:17.\nIn popular religion, good people zip off to heaven at the time of death. In Christianity, when Christians die, their souls go to Paradise (Luke 23:43, also called the Bosom of Abraham ) to await the Resurrection and the Last Judgment, after which they live in the New Jerusalem, also called the New Heavens and the New Earth.\nIn scripture, the word hell translates the Hebrew word Sheol and the Greek word hades, both of which refer to the realm of the dead. Before Christ, the souls of all the dead, whether wicked or righteous, went to this realm to await the Resurrection and the Judgment. In popular religion, hell refers to the place of eternal torment, which is called the Lake of Fire, Tartarus, or Gehenna in scripture. According to Jesus in Matthew 25:41, this place of eternal torment was designed for the devil and his angels, not for humans. Thus humans can escape this fate through repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation, justification, and sanctification.\nIntrinsically holy. Only God is intrinsically holy.\nA mundane object or person who is set aside for a holy purpose.\nThe words saint and holy have the same meaning. The only difference is in the usage: we use saint to refer to people and holy to refer to objects.\nThe act of God that frees a sinner from the penalty of sin.\nA church ceremony that acknowledges that God has called a person into professional ministry and formally delegates the duties and responsibilities of clergy to that person. In most cases, there is a lengthy ordination process that includes systematic examination and approval before the ordination is performed. Ordination is generally for life. An ordained person, like a lay person, can be consecrated to carry out a specific task or office. See also sanctification and consecration.\nOriginal sin is the doctrine that as descendants of Adam, we inherit his sinfulness, just as we inherit his humanity. In the west, primarily because of St. Augustine, this concept grew to include the idea that we inherit Adam\u2019s guilt. Calvin took Augustine\u2019s position to the extreme, teaching that we are totally depraved and without any natural virtue or worth whatsoever. The eastern Church teaches that we have inherited from Adam the state of sin, but not the guilt of sin. Therefore, despite original sin, we still possess the small amount of goodness necessary to realize our sinfulness, to choose good, and to repent of evil. The eastern Church teaches that if we were totally worthless, we would be totally irredeemable.\nAny voluntary act that results from repentance. Penance is a concrete expression of gratitude for the forgiveness of a debt that can never in fact be repaid.\nWillingness to correct a wrongdoing, synonymous with repentance.\nPredestination means that our destination is set in advance.\nCalvinists argue that predestination means that God has decided our eternal fate in advance and that we cannot choose it. However, we are still free to choose such things as fries or onion rings with our burger.\nHyper-Calvinists and others maintain that predestination means determinism, that we have absolutely no free will about anything; we are like actors saying our lines in a play. Therefore, they argue that some people are predestined for eternal punishment.\nThe rest of the historic Church argues that since it is not God\u2019s will for anyone to be lost (Matthew 18:14), all people are predestined to live with God in His glory. However, since they have free will, some may choose not to go to their destination and end up in hell. They also note that if a person\u2019s eternal fate was determined in the beginning, the Judgment took place on the first day, when in scripture it takes place on the last day.\nGod\u2019s benevolent intervention to supply needs.\nThe literal meaning is \u201cto change one\u2019s mind.\u201d The Greek and Hebrew words that are translated as repent can either mean a simple change of mind or a realization of sin with the accompanying resolve to reform. In some Bible translations, we find God repenting. In the original language, it simply means that God changed His mind. Repentance is the change of mind and penance is the change of deeds. For example, realizing that you were wrong to steal something is repentance, while returning the stolen goods is penance.\nWillingness to correct a wrongdoing, synonymous with penitence.\nA person who has been set aside for a holy life; in this sense, all Christians are saints, as in Philippians 1:1.\nA person whose life is upheld as spiritually exemplary. In some churches, there is a process for recognizing saints. In the Roman Catholic Church, it is a formal, centralized process. In Orthodox churches, the process is not centralized. In the Episcopal Church, it is done informally by the Prayer Book committee.\nTo set a person apart for a holy purpose. In most usages, sanctification is an act of the Holy Spirit that permanently transforms the person\u2019s inner nature. See also consecration and ordination.\nIn current usage, the meaning of the word \u201csin\u201d is restricted to \u201ca violation of a divine commandment.\u201d God commanded us not to judge other people, therefore judging other people is a sin, even if they don\u2019t know that we did it. Not all wrongdoings are sins. There is no divine commandment against stepping on someone\u2019s toe, so you would have to seek forgiveness from the owner of the toe, not God. If we offend more than one party, we have to confess to all of them. Confessing to God that you stole something doesn't relieve you of the need to admit it to the victim and to restore their property.\nThe Bible uses the word \u201csin\u201d in more general sense. It can mean an offense against a person.\nObviously, sins are not created equal; some are worse than others. Some churches have categorized and ranked sins according to severity and consequence, others don\u2019t see the need, since no matter how serious or trivial they are, your obligation is the same: confess, repent, and obtain forgiveness.\nA sin can be deliberate, accidental, unintentional, or out of ignorance. It could be something that you did long ago, and only realized now that it was a sin. It\u2019s still a sin."}

When hot it is an oxidizing agent, the sulfur in it being reduced; sulfur dioxide gas may be released. Hot concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with most metals and with several nonmetals, e.g., sulfur and carbon. Because the concentrated acid has a fairly high boiling point, it can be used to release more volatile acids from their salts, e.g., when sodium chloride (NaCl), or common salt, is heated with concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride gas, HCl, is evolved.\nConcentrated sulfuric acid has a very strong affinity for water. It is sometimes used as a drying agent and can be used to dehydrate (chemically remove water from) many compounds, e.g., carbohydrates. It reacts with the sugar sucrose, C12H22O11, removing eleven molecules of water, H2O, from each molecule of sucrose and leaving a brittle spongy black mass of carbon and diluted sulfuric acid. The acid reacts similarly with skin, cellulose, and other plant and animal matter.\nWhen the concentrated acid mixes with water, large amounts of heat are released; enough heat can be released at once to boil the water and spatter the acid. To dilute the acid, the acid should be added slowly to cold water with constant stirring to limit the buildup of heat.

Since it is dibasic (i.e., it has two replaceable hydrogen atoms in each molecule), it forms both normal sulfates (with both hydrogens replaced, e.g., sodium sulfate, Na2SO4) and acid sulfates, also called bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates (with only one hydrogen replaced, e.g., sodium bisulfate, NaHSO4).\nchemical compound, SO2, a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.

The sulfur dioxide is obtained by burning sulfur, by burning pyrites (iron sulfides), by roasting nonferrous sulfide ores preparatory to smelting, or by burning hydrogen sulfide gas. Some sulfuric acid is also made from ferrous sulfate waste solutions from pickling iron and steel and from waste acid sludge from oil refineries.\nIn the lead chamber process hot sulfur dioxide gas enters the bottom of a reactor called a Glover tower where it is washed with nitrous vitriol (sulfuric acid with nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, dissolved in it) and mixed with nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide gases; some of the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide and dissolved in the acid wash to form tower acid or Glover acid (about 78% H2SO4). From the Glover tower a mixture of gases (including sulfur dioxide and trioxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam) is transferred to a lead-lined chamber where it is reacted with more water. The chamber may be a large, boxlike room or an enclosure in the form of a truncated cone. Sulfuric acid is formed by a complex series of reactions; it condenses on the walls and collects on the floor of the chamber. There may be from three to twelve chambers in a series; the gases pass through each in succession. The acid produced in the chambers, often called chamber acid or fertilizer acid, contains 62% to 68% H2SO4. After the gases have passed through the chambers they are passed into a reactor called the Gay-Lussac tower where they are washed with cooled concentrated acid (from the Glover tower); the nitrogen oxides and unreacted sulfur dioxide dissolve in the acid to form the nitrous vitriol used in the Glover tower. Remaining waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere.\nIn the contact process, purified sulfur dioxide and air are mixed, heated to about 450\u00b0C;, and passed over a catalyst; the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide. The catalyst is usually platinum on a silica or asbestos carrier or vanadium pentoxide on a silica carrier. The sulfur trioxide is cooled and passed through two towers. In the first tower it is washed with oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, 100% sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide dissolved in it). In the second tower it is washed with 97% sulfuric acid; 98% sulfuric acid is usually produced in this tower. Waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere. Acid of any desired concentration may be produced by mixing or diluting the products of this process.\nSulfuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals. More of it is made each year than is made of any other manufactured chemical; more than 40 million tons of it were produced in the United States in 1990. It has widely varied uses and plays some part in the production of nearly all manufactured goods. The major use of sulfuric acid is in the production of fertilizers, e.g., superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate. It is widely used in the manufacture of chemicals, e.g., in making hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfate salts, synthetic detergents, dyes and pigments, explosives, and drugs. It is used in petroleum refining to wash impurities out of gasoline and other refinery products. Sulfuric acid is used in processing metals, e.g., in pickling (cleaning) iron and steel before plating them with tin or zinc. Rayon is made with sulfuric acid. It serves as the electrolyte in the lead-acid storage battery commonly used in motor vehicles (acid for this use, containing about 33% H2SO4 and with specific gravity about 1.25, is often called battery acid).\nAlthough sulfuric acid is now one of the most widely used chemicals, it was probably little known before the 16th cent. It was prepared by Johann Van Helmont (c.1600) by destructive distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) and by burning sulfur. The first major industrial demand for sulfuric acid was the Leblanc process for making sodium carbonate (developed c.1790). Sulfuric acid was produced at Nordhausen from green vitriol but was expensive. A process for its synthesis by burning sulfur with saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was first used by Johann Glauber in the 17th cent. and developed commercially by Joshua Ward in England c.1740. It was soon superseded by the lead chamber process, invented by John Roebuck in 1746 and since improved by many others. The contact process was originally developed c.1830 by Peregrine Phillips in England; it was little used until a need for concentrated acid arose, particularly for the manufacture of synthetic organic dyes.\nH2 SO4, a strong dibasic acid corresponding to the highest oxidation state of sulfur (+ 6). Under usual conditions, sulfuric acid is a heavy, oily, colorless, and odorless liquid. In industry, mixtures of sulfuric acid both with water and sulfur trioxide are also called sulfuric acid. If the SO3: H2 O molecular ratio is less than 1, the mixture is an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid; if it is more than 1, the mixture is a solution of SO3 in sulfuric acid.\nThe compounds H2 SO4\u00b7SO3 (H2 S2 O7, disulfuric, or pyrosulfuric acid, mp 35.15\u00b0C) and H2 SO4\u00b72SO3 (H2 S3 O10, trisulfuric acid, mp 1.20\u00b0C) are also formed. Only water vapor is given off into the vapor phase upon heating and boiling aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid containing up to 70 percent H2 S04. Vapors of sulfuric acid are formed above more concentrated solutions. A solution of 98.3 percent H2 SO4 (azeotropic mixture) upon boiling (336.5\u00b0C) is completely distilled. Sulfuric acid containing more than 98.3 percent H2 SO4 releases vapors of SO3 upon heating.\nSulfuric acid removes water that is chemically bound to organic compounds containing OH, or hydroxyl, groups. The dehydration of ethyl alcohol in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid results in the formation of ethylene or diethyl ether. The charring of sugar, cellulose, starch, and other carbohydrates upon contact with sulfuric acid also derives from the dehydration of these substances. As a dibasic acid, sulfuric acid forms two types of salts: sulfates and bisulfates.\nProduction. The first descriptions of oil of vitriol, that is, concentrated sulfuric acid, were given by the Italian scientist V. Biringuccio in 1540 and the German alchemist whose works were published under the name of Basilius Valentinus in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1690, the French chemists N. Lemery and N. Lefebvre had laid the basis for the first industrial method of obtaining sulfuric acid, a method applied in England in 1740. According to this method, a mixture of sulfur and saltpeter was burned in a ladle suspended in a glass jar containing a certain amount of water. The SO3 generated reacted with the water to form sulfuric acid. In 1746, J. Roebuck in Birmingham replaced the glass jars with chambers made of sheet lead, thus laying the basis for the chamber process for the production of sulfuric acid. Continuous improvement in the process for the production of sulfuric acid in Great Britain and France resulted in 1908 in the first tower system. In the USSR, the first tower installation went into operation in 1926 at the Po-levskoi Metallurgical Plant in the Urals.\nThe raw material for the production of sulfuric acid can be sulfur, pyrite (FeS2), or exhaust gases containing SO2 from furnaces for the oxidative roasting of the sulfide ores of Cu, Pb, Zn, and other metals. In the USSR, most sulfuric acid is obtained from pyrite. Here, the FeS2 is burned in furnaces in the state of a fluidized bed, a state achieved by blowing a rapid stream of air through a layer of finely ground pyrite. The gaseous mixture obtained contains SO2, O2, N2, impurities of SO3, and vapors of H2 O, As2 O3, and SiO2 and holds considerable cinder dust, which is removed from the gas in electrostatic precipitators.\nThe NO produced is converted into N2 O3, or, more precisely, a mixture of NO and NO2, in the oxidizing tower. The gases are then introduced into absorption towers, where they encounter sulfuric acid supplied from the top. It is here that nitrous vitriol is obtained; the mixture is then transferred to the production towers. Thus, there is continuous production and a circulation of nitrogen oxides. The inevitable losses of nitrogen oxides with the exhaust gases are balanced by the addition of HNO3.\nThe sulfuric acid produced by the nitrous method is of insufficient concentration and contains harmful impurities, for example. As. Production is accompanied by the release of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere (\u201cfoxtails,\u201d named for the color of NO2).\nDepending on the amount of water introduced into the process, either oleum or a solution of sulfuric acid in water is obtained.\nIn 1973 the production of sulfuric acid (in the monohydrate) was (in millions of tons): 14.9 in the USSR, 28.7 in the United States, 7.1 in Japan, 5.5 in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4.4 in France, 3.9 in Great Britain, 3.0 in Italy, 2.9 in Poland, 1.2 in Czechoslovakia, 1.1 in the German Democratic Republic, and 0.9 in Yugoslavia.\nUSE. Sulfuric acid is one of the most important products of the heavy chemical industry. The available grades include chamber acid (not less than 75 percent H2 SO4), oil of vitriol (not less than 92.5 percent), and oleum, or fuming sulfuric acid (a solution of 18.5\u201320 percent SO3 in H2 SO4), as well as especially pure battery acid (92\u201394 percent; when diluted by water to 26\u201331 percent, it serves as the electrolyte in lead batteries). In addition, reagent-grade sulfuric acid (92\u201394 percent) is produced by the contact process in quartz or platinum apparatus. The strength of sulfuric acid is determined by the density, which is measured with a hydrometer. Most of the chamber acid is used in the production of mineral fertilizers. Sulfuric acid is used in the production of, for example, phosphoric, hydrochloric, boric, and hydrofluoric acids because of its ability to displace these acids from their salts. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used in separating organosulfur compounds and unsaturated organic compounds from petroleum products. Dilute sulfuric acid is used for the removal of scale from wire and sheets before plating with tin or zinc and for the pickling of metal surfaces before plating with chromium, nickel, or copper. It is used in metallurgy for the decomposition of complex ores, in particular, those of uranium. In organic synthesis, concentrated sulfuric acid is a necessary component of nitrating mixtures and a sulfonating agent in the production of many dyes and pharmaceuticals. Owing to its high hygroscopicity, sulfuric acid is used in drying gases and in concentrating nitric acid.\nSafety measures. Poisonous gases\u2014SO2 and NO2\u2014as well as vapors of SO3 and H2 SO4, present a danger in the production of sulfuric acid. Proper ventilation and hermetically sealed production apparatus are therefore mandatory. Since sulfuric acid causes serious burns of the skin, handling requires extreme care and protective devices (goggles, rubber gloves, aprons, boots). When diluting sulfuric acid, the acid must be poured into water in a thin stream while stirring. Pouring the water into the acid leads to spattering because of the evolution of a great amount of heat.\nSpravochnik sernokislotchika, 2nd ed. Edited by K. M. Malin. Moscow, 1971.\nMalin, K. M., N.

{"id": 3878, "text": "In this study, the reinforcement of wooden beams with fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP) for restorative and constructive purposes was investigated. Two application-oriented processes were developed and evaluated for the production of static as well as dynamic highly stressed fiber reinforced wood composites (FRWC). For that purpose, spruce wood (Picea abies Karst.) was reinforced with carbon fiber and basalt fiber rovings and the static short-run behavior was tested by a four-point bending test. The results show a significant increase in bending stiffness (66%) and bending strength (54%) even for a small degree of reinforcement (3% and 6% by cross section). A parametric simulation model of the four-point bending test was established to predict the bending stiffness as well as to simulate both material and geometry parameters. The simulated and experimental results show good correlations.\nBergner, K. ; Tosch, M. ; Zauer, M. ; Spickenheuer, A. ; Wagenf\u00fchr, A. ; Heinrich, G."}

{"id": 7682, "text": "Anderson\u2019s disease is also known as chylomicron retention disease which is a rare hereditary disease. It is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by low plasma lipid and low lipid-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin E and vitamin D). After the digestion of food, lipids, and lipid soluble vitamins are absorbed in the human body with the help of chylomicrons. A lack of chylomicron can interrupt the transport of molecules from intestine to the bloodstream resulting in malabsorption. Subjects with these disorders show different clinical manifestations which were initially described by Anderson and colleagues, hence it was called as \u201cAnderson\u2019s disease\u201d. Genotyping has revealed that Anderson's and chylomicron retention disease are in fact the same disease.\nAnderson' disease and chylomicron retention disease is the same disease which has been proved genotypically. The disease is caused by the mutation in the gene SAR1B (formerly SARA2), which encodes the SAR1B protein. Mutation results in the defect in chylomicron secretion, a transport protein. A lack of transport of dietary lipids from the intestine to the bloodstream causes malabsorption, which is the main characteristic of the disorder. Malabsorption syndrome with steatorrhea and growth retardation is usually seen in chylomicron retention disease.\nChylomicrons are the transport lipids that primarily involved in carrying of dietary lipids such as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins which are secreted generally from the enterocytes. It is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum of the absorptive cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine. These large lipoproteins range from 700 to 6000 \u00c5 size which contains a single molecule of apolipoprotein (apo) B-48. It is a sole molecule, essential for chylomicron structure organization. Apo B-100 is different which is found within very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) secreted by the liver and in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a catabolic product of VLDL.\nIt is rarely diagnosed in infants presenting with failure to thrive and chronic diarrhea. Malabsorption syndrome with steatorrhea and growth retardation is usually seen in chylomicron retention disease. Steatorrhea is the excretion of abnormal quantities of fat with the feces owing to reduced absorption of fat by the intestine. If not treated, it can cause subsequent neurological impairment. Neurological signs, although variable, consisting most frequently of a loss of reflexes. There is little acanthocytosis (red blood cells appear like thorny), hypocholesterolemia, hypotriglyceridemia, lipid malabsorption, diarrhea, retinitis pigmentosa, and spinocerebellar degeneration are negative of chylomicron retention disease.\nChylomicron retention disease is usually caused by gene mutations, particularly in the SAR1B gene. The SAR1B gene has instruction for Sar1b protein, which is involved in chylomicron transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. In fact, Sar1-GTP forms a coating protein complex with two heterodimers Sec23/24 and Sec 13/31, which initiates budding and captures cargo to eject vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.\nSAR1B gene mutations impair the release of chylomicrons into the bloodstream. A lack of chylomicrons in the blood prevents dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from being used by the body, leading to the nutritional and developmental problems seen in people with chylomicron retention disease.\nWhy Is It Referred To As Autosomal Recessive Pattern?\nChylomicron retention disease is a good example for inherited autosomal recessive pattern. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition typically do not show any signs or symptoms of the condition. To have an autosomal recessive disorder, entities must inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent. These conditions are commonly passed on by two carriers. Their health is not often pretentious, but they have one mutated gene (recessive gene) and one normal gene (dominant gene) for the condition. With each pregnancy, two carriers have a 25 percent chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes, a 50 percent chance of having an unaffected child who is also a carrier and a 25 percent chance of having an affected child with two recessive genes."}
