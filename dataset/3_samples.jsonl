{"id": 3143, "text": "The 1932 NFL season was the 13th regular season of the National Football League. The Boston Braves (the current Washington Redskins) joined the NFL before the season, whereas the loss of the Providence Steam Roller, Cleveland Indians and Frankford Yellow Jackets dropped league membership to eight teams, the lowest in NFL history; the league also had eight teams in 1943 due to World War II.\nAlthough the Green Bay Packers finished the season with 10 wins, the league title was determined at the time by winning percentage with ties excluded, so the Portsmouth Spartans and the Chicago Bears finished the season tied for first place (6\u20131). Since both games between the teams ended in ties, the NFL arranged for the first ever playoff game to determine the NFL champion.\nExtremely cold weather forced the game to be moved from Wrigley Field to the indoor Chicago Stadium. The makeshift football field in the stadium was only 80 yards long with undersized endzones, forcing officials to move the goal posts to the goal line due to a lack of space to put them at the back of the end zone, as was standard in college and professional football. This change was favored by players and fans, and the goal posts were moved to the goal line as one of several rule changes the league made in 1933, with the rule lasting until 1973.\nThe Bears won the playoff game 9\u20130, which was scoreless until the fourth quarter, and as the game counted in the final standings, the Spartans finished in third place. The Spartans became the Detroit Lions in 1934.\nBecause the Portsmouth Spartans and the Chicago Bears finished the season tied for first place, a playoff game was held to determine the NFL champion.\nThe league decreased to eight teams in 1932.\nFollowing the 1932 season, the NFL would be split into two divisions (later two conferences), with the champions of each meeting in a championship game.\nThis was the result of the end of the 1932 season, where there was a tie for first in the standings at the end of the regular season: as tied games did not count until 1972, the Spartans record of 6\u20131\u20134 and the Bears record of 6\u20131\u20136 were taken to be six wins, one loss, giving both an .857 win percentage.\nHad pure win-loss differential or the current (post-1972) system of counting ties as half a win, half a loss been in place in 1932, the Packers' record of 10\u20133\u20131 (.750, +7) would have won them a fourth consecutive championship, ahead of the Spartans' 6\u20131\u20134 (.727, +5) and the Bears' 6\u20131\u20136 (.692, +5).\nThe Green Bay Packers were unbeaten (8\u20130\u20131) after nine games, and after the Thanksgiving weekend, their 10\u20131\u20131 record (.909) was still well ahead of Portsmouth at 5\u20131\u20134 (.833) and Chicago at 4\u20131\u20136 (.800).\nIn Week Twelve (December 4), the Spartans handed the Packers a 19\u20130 defeat, while the Bears beat the Giants 6\u20130. Portsmouth, at 6\u20131\u20134 (.857), took the lead, while the Packers (10\u20132\u20131) and the Bears (5\u20131\u20136) were tied for second (.833).\nIn Week Thirteen, the Bears hosted the Packers; a Green Bay win would have the Packers finish second with an 11\u20132\u20131 record (.846) and hand Portsmouth their first ever title. The Bears beat the Packers 9\u20130, meaning they finished 6\u20131\u20136, and tied for first in the standings with Portsmouth.\nThough it was described as a \"playoff\", the Bears 9\u20130 win over Portsmouth on December 18 counted in the regular season standings. As such, the Bears finished at 7\u20131\u20136 (.875) and won the 1932 title, with the Packers runners-up, and the Spartans, at 6\u20132\u20134 (.750), finished third.\nKenneth \"Ken\" R. Wendt (January 29, 1910 \u2013 January 19, 1982) was an American football player, jurist, and politician.\nWendt was a guard for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League in 1932. He then served in the Illinois General Assembly and as a judge in Cook County, Illinois.\nThe National Football League champions, prior to the merger between the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) in 1970, were determined by two different systems. The National Football League was established on September 17, 1920, as the American Professional Football Association (APFA). The APFA changed its name in 1922 to the National Football League, which it has retained ever since.From 1921 to 1931, the APFA/NFL determined its champion by overall win\u2013loss record, with no playoff games; ties were not counted in the winning percentage total. The APFA did not keep records of the 1920 season; they declared the Akron Pros, who finished the season with an 8\u20130\u20133 (8 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties) record, as the league's first champions, by a vote of the owners, with the Buffalo-All Americans and Decatur Staleys also claiming the title. According to modern-tie breaking rules, the Buffalo All-Americans tied Akron for the championship. The Canton Bulldogs won two straight championships from 1922 to 1923, and the Green Bay Packers won three in a row from 1929 to 1931.There also has been controversy over the championshipships of the 1921 APFA season and the 1925 NFL season, with the Buffalo All-Americans laying claim to another championship in an incident known as the \"Staley Swindle\" and the Pottsville Maroons being stripped of their championship in 1925 for playing an exhibition game against college football powerhouse Notre Dame's famed Four Horsemen, leading to a last minute field goal victory for the Maroons, stunning the crowd and nation, and also put the NFL ahead of college football for the first time ever. These three disputed championships contributed to the beginning of the NFL's rich history.\nThe 1932 NFL season resulted in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, and could not be resolved by the typical win\u2013loss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game in each of the four seasons before the completed merger. The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.The Green Bay Packers won the most NFL championships before the merger, winning eleven of the fifty championships. The Packers were also the only team to win three straight championships, an achievement they accomplished twice: from 1929\u201331 and from 1965\u201367. The Chicago Bears won a total of eight titles, and the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and New York Giants each won four. The Bears recorded the largest victory in a championship game, defeating the Washington Redskins 73\u20130 in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; six other title games ended in a shutout as well. The Philadelphia Eagles recorded two consecutive shutouts in 1948 and 1949. New York City hosted the most championship games (eight), while the highest-attended title game was the 1955 NFL Championship Game, where 85,693 fans showed up in Los Angeles to watch the Browns beat the Rams 38\u201314.\nStaten Island () is one of the five boroughs of New York City, in the U.S. state of New York. Located in the southwest portion of the city, the borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With an estimated population of 479,458 in 2017, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in land area at 58.5 sq mi (152 km2). The borough also contains the southern-most point in the state, South Point.\nThe borough is coextensive with Richmond County and until 1975 was referred to as the Borough of Richmond. Staten Island has sometimes been called \"the forgotten borough\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government.The North Shore\u2014especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton and Stapleton\u2014is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the 2.5-mile (4 km) F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest boardwalk in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island."}
