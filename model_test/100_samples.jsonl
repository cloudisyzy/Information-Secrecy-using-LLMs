{"sample_id": 26025, "text": "Farm Founded in 1995 Our story starts back in January of 1995\u2014a time when family farms were on the brink of extinction. There was only a handful of organic farmers left in British Columbia\u2019s Okanagan Valley which shared a love for the land. We We also shared the belief that a new, sustainable approach to agriculture could help family farms and rural communities survive. Folks back then, just like you today, were concerned with food quality and environmental issues. They were looking for more natural, nutritious food\u2014food grown without synthetic and potentially harmful pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. realized that most of the local produce was being processed and distributed through government packing houses. The produce is often layered with wax preservatives for longer storage life and eventually reaching the consumer months later. Many farmers began picking their crops fresh, packing it up in their trucks and driving further away from the Okanagan Valley to share all this delicious organic produce with new communities. After a couple years of pop-up fruit stands and travelling all over British Columbia, including many communities on the Gulf Islands, it became a sustainable business to grow and deliver their own crops. A truly great feeling, and all the hard work pays off. Alas, the Farmers Markets are buzzing and many of us have the opportunity to eat organic fresh produce. Unfortunately, many fruits and vegetables are seasonal in BC which leaves an unhealthy gap in our diet and nutrition. Veden has set a mission to recover those lost months by collectively sourcing ingredients from organic farmers across British Columbia and some! Taking full advantage of the exciting new Far-Infrared Technology, Veden was created to make organic plant-based nutrition accessible and affordable for anyone!! While the Farmers Market communities continued to blossom, we began growing a variety of fruits, vegetables, seeds and herbs to blend up smoothies at our booth. It wasn\u2019t long until we outgrew our little smoothie bar and had to find a new way of distributing our produce. When we found out about Far-Infrared Technology, we created Veden with a promise to make organic raw plant-based nutrition accessible and affordable for anyone who wants it!"}

We'd love to hear the results on our Facebook page.\nIt is nothing less than the global challenge of our time. A slow motion disaster, caused and perpetuated each day by all of us - leaving each of us either feeling powerless in the face of its enormity or in denial of an inconvenient scientifically proved truth. Our world is warming.\nRecently predictions have gotten more dire, more certain. There is now a timeline for serious impacts to be felt. Much like the adage about planting trees, the time to act was either 20 years ago - or now.\nMontgomery County's 93,000 acre Ag Reserve was envisioned at its creation in 1980 as a way to keep farms on the landscape and it has been successful, but it has also served as a \"green lung\" and water filter for the region, its forests sucking in Co2, its pervious surfaces allowing re-absorption of large rainfall events. But the County, the Reserve and MCA as its steward can (and must) do more to combat our climate challenge and mitigate the coming impacts.\nThe county has made a climate change pledge for the county of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. The county is also working toward Executive Leggett's goal of being a zero waste county - starting with recycling/composting 70% of materials by 2023. MCA is proud to serve on the county's Zero Waste Task Force.\nRegenerative agriculture may be a new term to many. It is a set of farming practices becoming increasingly popular as a way to increase crop yields, reduce pesticide use and capture atmospheric carbon. The general idea is to increase cover crops and perennial vegetation, till the soil less and utilize compost to lock Co2 in the air into the soil while increasing plant growth. Farmer Matt Rales, formerly of Potomac is doing this now on 800 acres in Virginia. Maryland has been the pioneer state taking steps to promote this climate mitigation practice with the Healthy Soils Act of 2017. MCA would like to help interested farmers implement these practices in Montgomery County.\nHow we farm matters but crop selection can also have an impact. The recently passed Farm Bill has finally lifted a national ban on growing hemp. This crop has the potential to be a game change for sustainable farming, waste and carbon reduction. Banned from US farms since 1937 because of an unfair association with its wilder cousin marijuana, industrial hemp production is poised to have impacts in the fields of medicine, plastics, food, auto manufacturer, the list goes on. MCA is taking the lead on getting farmers growing here in Montgomery County.\nAt MCA, our mission is to protect the farms and open spaces of the Ag Reserve but we all have a role to play in the challenges ahead. We can choose grim disaffection, denial or action. Help us position the Ag Reserve as a climate change mitigation tool for our county and region. We would be honored by your tax-deductible end of year gift. Thank You!\nHaving just joined the family in the annual It's a Wonderful Life viewing, I thought, once again, about how truly remarkable and unique the Reserve is... and how fragile. Remember the film's gripping scene when there is a run on the local bank and George Bailey spots a crowd of frightened shareholders descending on the family's savings and loan? George Bailey's earnest explanation of the benefits that the Savings and Loan provided, both individually and collectively, brought all but one, who still demanded his entire $242, to understand that there was a imperative to sustain the institution. They each took what they needed without crushing the savings and loan.\nSo it is, as I see it, with the Ag Reserve. We could easily wring every last dime out of the land for the benefit of a few at the expense of the many... sure we could.\ndeplete the Reserve by turning a blind eye to important preservation goals for open space and natural and historic resources. But much like the community service provided by Bailey Bros. Savings and Loan, the Reserve pays dividends in clean air, water quality, open space, food and fiber - the list goes on. The survival of farming and the Reserve is a commonly shared goal and we have all invested so much in it.\nHow do we arrive at a consensus as to the best means to keeping the land in farming and protecting open space and natural resources in the face of myriad challenges and pressures? Meeting this challenge is precisely what we do each day.\nSince 2001, we have been the organization on the ground protecting the quality of our farms, open space and water supply. Our collaborative and tenacious approach has lead us to be called \"one of the best\" nonprofits in the region. Your tax deductible investment in our community stays here but goes far to ensure a future for local farms.\n-Terracycle partners with large international brands to offer reusable containers called LOOP.\n-Why do toothpaste tubes come in outer boxes?\nMCA has been an active member in the County's Zero Waste Task Force. While the recycling rate is at 50% currently, the County is aiming to recycle 70% of its waste by 2023. Zero Waste is a really big goal and we are proud to work on it with other local stakeholders. The first step in the undertaking has been gathering data- that is why both MCA and the County have undertaken surveys to find out what is working at the household level. Thanks to all those that took the time to participate. The results are below.\n- Food Scraps make up 21% of total landfill-bound waste in the County. While much of that food would biodegrade to make soil in the right conditions, this does not happen in a landfill. Many respondents want to see curbside composting.\n- Residents also want to be able to recycle more of their waste (specifically plastics, styrofoam and bulk items such as mattresses).\n-Better education on what can be recycled and why recycling is important was seen by many respondents as a good first step toward waste reduction.\nUpdate - New Windsor in Carroll County has tried a \"Pay as you Throw\" approach to trash and it seems to be working.\nMCA is able to work with stakeholders across the County because of your support!

{"sample_id": 92171, "text": "For Weekly Geeks #16, Dewey asked us to pair up with another blogger, interview each other about a book we've read recently or an old favourite, and then post both interviews together. My partner is Becky. She interviewed me about Tell my Horse by Zora Neale Hurston, and I interviewed her about The Devouring: Sorry Night by Simon Holt - both unsettling books, but in very different ways.\nI read a plot summary of this book that mentioned a girl discovering an old journal. This put me in mind of the book I'm currently reading, The Historian. What did you think of this particular plot element? Did it work well in the story?\nIt worked very well. The story is narrated by a teen girl, Regina \"Reggie\" Halloway. She works at a local horror bookshop--and she \"discovers\" the journal when she's unpacking boxes of books. It's one-of-a-kind. A hand-written journal. And it's something she sneaks home with. She begins reading--and she thinks it's chilling but delightfully so. She begins reading it aloud to her younger brother as a bed time story, and that is when this story takes on a life of its own.\nBury your fears on Sorry Night.\nComes the feasting of the Vours.\nYour body's here but not your soul...\"\nHow would you describe this book's atmosphere? Is there anything you'd compare it to?\nThe atmosphere is dark and spooky. I haven't read much horror--though I've read The Historian and Dracula last year--so I don't have a direct comparison. But it's good. Very good.\nWhat did you think of the characters? Were they believable and full-fleshed?\nMostly. I'd be lying if I said the book was perfect. I think the characters are well done enough that you're willing to go along with the book because it hooks you. Regina and her brother Henry. Reggie's best friend, Aaron. But some of the other characters--the father, the crush, the bookshop owner, are not as well fleshed as the others.\nIt helps to know that this is the first in a series, I believe. I read that somewhere this past weekend. I just can't remember where. I hope there are more books. I bet those characters--minus the crush--become more developed and more integral to the story.\nIs this one of those books that are actually scary, or is it more the atmospheric and vaguely unsettling kind? And if you did find it scary, why?\nThis is very subjective. I know some people get spooked easily, and others it really takes quite a lot to manipulate them into being scared. It was definitely unsettling, but I feel safe in saying that it will scare some readers. I found it scary--not in the hide under the covers or put the book in the freezer way--but scary enough that I wanted to get my mind safely onto another subject before bedtime.\nThe book has a chilling premise. And the way this novel unfolds, it's very unnerving--to watch the characters realize what has happened and to try to fight back against the Vours.\nI find that I'm particularly picky with endings when it comes to horror stories. Did the ending of this one work for you? Was it satisfying? And if explaining without spoilers is possible, why or why not?\nMostly. As I said, I think this is the first in a series. So not everything is resolved at the end. And in some ways, it leaves a lot of things unanswered. You're more curious at the end then in the beginning. In a way. But it's not a cliffhanger ending either. There's room for more, but you're not going to be screaming in frustration either. There's enough action this book merits readers spending their time on it.\nI just googled and found the sequel is coming out in May 2009. I'll definitely be seeking it out.\nHow does this compare with other YA horror books you've read recently? I noticed you have quite a lot of them on your RIP list, so if you could recommend just a single one of the ones you've read so far, which one would it be?\nThank you, Becky! I for one am extremely curious about The Devouring: Sorry Night. It sounds so deliciously creepy.\nNow here is Becky's interview with me about Tell my Horse. First, a bit of context: Originally published in 1937, Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica is Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s report of her travels and research in those two countries. It\u2019s a fascinating account of local history, customs, folklore, mythology, and of course, of voodoo practices.\nWhy did you choose to pick up Tell My Horse? Is it for Carl's R.I.P. III challenge by any chance?\nOne of my favourite short stories in Neil Gaiman\u2019s Fragile Things is \u201cBitter Grounds\u201d, a story about zombies and New Orleans, among other things. The story mentions this book at one point \u2013 quotes from it, actually \u2013 and that\u2019s how I first heard of it. Then a long time passed and I sort of forgot about it. But just recently I was thinking that it was about time I read a book about Caribbean culture and folklore, a topic that fascinates me. So I went ahead and ordered it.\nI didn\u2019t start reading it with R.I.P in mind, but now that you mention it, I think that it totally fits even though it\u2019s non-fiction. Some chapters were quite chilling!\nIs this your first book by Zora Neale Hurston? Or is she a favorite author?\nYep, it was my first.\nWill you be wanting to pick up another Hurston book at some point?\nA big yes! I just loved her writing. Her descriptions are so vivid. I remember that you and Chris reviewed Their Eyes Were Watching God earlier this year, and it sounds like something I\u2019d really enjoy. I also really want to read Men and Mules, her book on African-American folklore.\nIs it a book you'd recommend to others? Who do you think would enjoy this book?\nI would definitely recommend it. I think that anyone interested in Caribbean culture and folklore, not to mention in Zombies, will absolutely love this book. But you really don\u2019t need to be particularly into these topics to enjoy it. The book is so readable, so engaging, that I bet any random reader could easily be sucked in. It\u2019s one of those books that entertain you, unsettle you, and also teach you a bunch of little things you never knew \u2013 about the history of Haiti, for example.\nWhat was your favorite aspect of the book? Least favorite?\nOne of my favourite aspects was Zora Neale Hurston herself. You can feel her presence in the pages, and she sounds like such an assertive and strong and curious and intelligent woman. I love the fact that she describes what she sees without judgement, but also doesn\u2019t refrain from speaking her mind about topics like male chauvinism, social inequality and poverty, corruption, etc. It was interesting to see her deconstruct common misconceptions about voodoo \u2013 the voodoo dolls, black magic kind of stuff. Instead, she portrays it as a social and cultural phenomenon that is an essential part of Haiti, and as a religion with African roots. I also loved her honesty. She doesn\u2019t try to sound like she knows more than actually does. She doesn\u2019t hide the fact that most people in Haiti were reluctant to talk about certain things, especially to a foreigner. So when she wasn\u2019t able to find out much about a certain topic, she simply says so.\nOther favourite aspects include the description of a Jamaican funeral \u2013 it was fascinating stuff! According to their tradition, the ghost, or duppy, leaves the grave three days after the burial, and returns on the ninth day. So on that day they have a ceremony where people say goodbye to the deceased person, sing songs, and tell Anansi stories. There are also a number of precautions that are taken to ensure that the duppy does return to the grave after nine days and doesn\u2019t become a dangerous wandering spirit. I also loved the descriptions of the different types of voodoo ceremonies, of the several gods or loas, etc.\nMy least favourite thing? Well, the book isn\u2019t very long and it covers a lot of ground, so sometimes it isn\u2019t as detailed as I wanted it to be. It made me want to know more, which is of course a good thing. There is something else, but it\u2019s not a flaw. Some of the descriptions of rituals that involve animal sacrifices are not for the faint of heart. Zora Neale Hurston is describing what she saw, so if she left these things out the book wouldn\u2019t be a very good one. I\u2019m glad she included them, but although she avoids being unnecessarily gory, some bits were hard to read.\nAny favorite passages you'd want to share?\nEvery precaution for keeping duppies in graves must be taken. So as soon as the body was placed in the coffin, the pillow with the parched peas, corn and coffee beans sewed inside it was placed under his head. Then they took stronger methods. They took four short nails and drove one in each cuff of the shirt as close to the hands as possible to hold the hands firmly in place. The heel of each sock was nailed down in the same way. Now the duppy was \u2018nailed hand and foot\u2019.\nNo one can stay in Haiti long without hearing Zombies mentioned in one way or another, and the fear of this thing and all that it means seeps over the country like a ground current of cold air. This fear is real and deep.\nClick here to read Becky's post.\nFantastic interviews! I really enjoyed them both very much...and am definitely adding both books to the old wish list. I'm especially looking forward to Tell My Horse. I'm hoping to spend some time maybe next year learning about various religions with Annie. Of course, the major ones, but would really, really love to learn about others as well. This sounds like a perfect book for us to read! Thank you Nymeth and Becky!\nBoth of these books sound excellent and what a fun idea to do interviews. An enjoyable post!\nThis is a lovely read! Haven't read Fragile Things yet. And now I want me some NZH! Hahaha!\nDewey: I'm glad you thought so :) She also wrote an autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, which sounds really interesting.\nBecky: It was fun :) And I think I'd be interested in a Zora Neale Hurston challenge, yes. I hope more people are.\nDebi: This book would be great because she'd no longer learn about religion, but about the history of Jamaica and Haiti, their culture and traditions, etc. It's such an interesting topic! Okay, maybe I'm biased :P But for me it really is.\nCath, glad you liked it!\nMelody, I look forward to your interview.\nHeather, you might be interested in her autobiography, then, Dust Tracks on a Road. I haven't read it yet, but it sounds so interesting! Tell My Horse was actually not as creepy as a book about voodoo and zombies might have been, though. There were creepy bits, but for the most part she approaches the topic in such a human way. It made me see voodoo in a completely new light.\nThe Devouring does look really good and it's fun to be able to look forward to a sequel. Tell My Horse sounds interesting as well. Glad you both had fun with this mini challenge.\nTerrific interviews! I'm adding Tell My Horse to my wishlist, it sounds so interesting especially as you mention that it describes a Jamaican funeral. You can learn so much about a culture from studying both marriage and funeral traditions.\nThanks, book zombie! I totally agree with you about marriages and funerals. I hope you enjoy the book!\nMy TBR pile just keeps increasing. Not fair!"}

In training to become a Sacramento chiropractor, I learned that taking a good patient history of the \"chief complaint\" is vital to an accurate diagnosis: What happened? What hurts? How bad? How long? Does is burn, ache, throb? Does anything help? Etc.\nI've got to admit, I've heard some \"doozie\" stories: \"I fell off the ladder.\" I took a tumble off the roof.\" \"I skied into a pole.\" \"I got rear-ended.\" \"I tried to lift the...\" There seem to be an endless list of major back catastrophes.\nMore often than not however, I hear stories \"incredible\" stories like these: \"I bent over to pick up my shoe, my back went out, and now I am in so much pain, I can't stand it.\" Or \"I got out of bed and by back went into spasm. That was a week ago!\" Once I heard this one; \"I leaned over while brushing my teeth, and I couldn't straighten-up. Now my leg is numb too.\"\nThese minimal events cause many more problems than the major traumas. Seems crazy huh! It does not make sense to most people how such little stresses can cause such severe problems.\nWhen you understand how backs typically fail, it makes perfect sense. I sometimes use with the following example: Perhaps you remember the marble game called Kerplunk? Picture a vertical clear plastic cylinder with several long colored sticks going through the sides in all directions. Then there are a few dozen marbles sitting on top of them.\nThe game requires the player to cautiously remove only one stick at a time, being careful not to let the marbles fall through. Finally, when a player removes just one too many straws, it's Kerplunk! Some or all of the marbles fall to the bottom and that player is the loser. Backs go Kerplunk too. It happens all the time and is the cause of much pain, disability and confusion.\nThe reason most backs fail is actually simple. It is no mystery to spinal specialists. Over the course of a lifetime, your back is subjected to numerous stresses and strains from normal activities and perhaps a few more significant injuries. They can be minor, have little symptoms, and are usually self-limiting, meaning within a few days or weeks, the pain goes away all by itself.\nIt is important to look deep into the back to understand what that means. Whenever there is enough stress on any joint of the back, there is some microscopic tearing of the tissue that holds you together (ligaments) and those that stabilize your back ( core muscles).\nWhen there are these \"sub-failure\" micro-tear injuries happen, the body will initiate the normal process of inflammation. This process involves an amazing sequence of healing chemistry that leads to the actual repair of the injured tissue. The tissue repair is ultimately performed by specialized cells called fibroblasts. Within a few weeks, they complete the repair with what is essentially, scar tissue.\nIf the injured parts are not re-aligned and mobilized during healing, this poorly adapted scar tissue can glue-up the joints and limit normal movement and function.\nWithout normal function, the deep core stabilizing muscles don't get full action as you move through your day, and like any unused muscle, they weaken and can't do their job. This weakening is often slow and progressive. Then, just like the weakening support of the marbles as the sticks are withdrawn in the Kerplunk game, stabilization is lost and it only takes a very small stress to make your back go \"Kerplunk\"-more tissue damage, spasm, pain and disability.\nI highly recommend you visit my Sacramento Chiropractic practice for an honest assessment of your Kerpunk-li-ness, and I'll help you keep all your marbles where they belong!\nSacramento Chiropractor / Why Backs Fail / Anderson Chiropractic Clinic, Inc."}

{"sample_id": 67647, "text": "The 5 Keys - NUTRITION - Elson Haas, M.D.\nWe have more potential control over what we eat than in any other area of our lives, so this is a good place to begin, even though it can be a challenge. Our Diet is what we eat and Nutrition is comprised of the many nutrients our body can digest and assimilate from our foods. Food can bring us much pleasure and sustenance and it\u2019s certainly part of sharing our lives with others. Plus, our food choices influence our health directly in positive and negative ways. We are challenged and tempted early in our lives with all the tasty, sweetened, quick snacks available and advertised to us. Do we need to eat the hippest foods to fit in, or can we enjoy the basics of nature to nourish ourselves fully? Of course, nutrition is a complex subject and in my career as an author and teacher, I have explored this topic more than any other, in my books Staying Healthy with Nutrition, The False Fat Diet, and The Detox Diet. You can learn more from these sources and my website.\nOur bodies have more than a hundred different cell types requiring millions of biochemical reactions to work properly helping our bodies to thrive optimally. When we do not eat a sufficiently nutritious diet, nor have good digestion and assimilation to deliver the nutrients to our cells, our bodies (and minds) cannot be running at 100%. When we expose our cells to more toxins than our body can readily detoxify and eliminate, our cellular and tissue functions may be undermined. Over time, this can lead to many acute and chronic symptoms, as well as a myriad of diseases. The key here is to eat healthy, nourishing foods, especially vegetables, proteins, and fruits, and to avoid toxins whenever possible. Another part of this Key is to learn how food and supplements help us recover and heal when symptoms or illness occur. This may involve habit changes and detoxification/elimination diets as a start. These simple changes in our lifestyle habits can correct many underlying health problems.\nOver the last 40 years I have found that one of the best ways to begin and continue the journey to optimal health is with a natural cleansing and detoxification program. Detoxification can be as simple as avoiding certain foods for a period of time, like with a juice fast, or involve specific cleansing programs and various detoxification herbs and supplements. An elimination diet mainly involves avoiding certain foods for some time to see how your body reacts to them. This is often the first step in assessing food allergies, sensitivities, or any adverse food reactions. Ideally, at the very least, we should take an occasional break from sugar, caffeine, alcohol, as well as dairy and wheat products and see how we feel. I truly believe that if our entire nation did this for three weeks, half of people\u2019s symptoms and medical conditions would be lessened. If you want to try this for yourself, you can learn more from my book The Detox Diet."}

During the meeting, Shamkhani condemned ostensible American and Israeli attempts to remove the Palestinian issue from the international agenda, the report said.\n\u201cThe U.S. and the Zionist regime feel threatened by any balance shift in the Middle East in favor of regional people and governments engaged in the fight against terrorism. They seek to obstruct the path of anti-terrorism fight by bringing up unfounded pretexts such as blocking Iran\u2019s regional sway,\u201d Shamkhani said.\nHamas deputy chief Salah al-Arouri, who is leading the delegation, thanked Iran for its patronage and noted that senior officials in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were interested in expanding ties with Tehran. Aruri noted that Israel had set three preconditions for the beginning of negotiations, including the disarmament of Hamas, recognition of Israel, and severing ties with Iran.\n\u201cIn response to the first prerequisite that was disarmament of Hamas, we have declared that we don\u2019t accept it at all,\u201d he said, adding that they also totally reject the second condition of recognizing Israel. \u201cOur presence in Iran is the practical denial of the third precondition that was cutting ties with Iran,\u201d Aruri stressed.\nHe commended Iran\u2019s important support for the Palestinian people and said Hamas leaders are determined to boost cooperation with Iran. He also condemned Takfiri groups\u2019 acts of violence in the name of Islam and said such inhumane measures are aimed at serving the interests of the U.S., Israel and their allies.\nThe high-ranking Hamas delegation began its visit to Iran on Friday to inform its backers in Tehran about reconciliation efforts with rival Palestinian faction Fatah, an official from the terror group told AFP.\nAruri is leading a high-ranking Hamas delegation which arrived in Tehran on Friday for talks with Iranian officials including Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.\n\u201cNo one in the universe can disarm us. On the contrary, we will continue to have the power to protect our citizens. No one has the ability to extract from us recognition of the occupation,\u201d Yahya Sinwar said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet said in a statement on Tuesday that Tel Aviv would not engage in negotiations with a future Palestinian unity government that had the backing of Hamas. Both Hamas and its Ramallah-based rival Fatah were quick to brush off Netanyahu\u2019s threats, with the Palestinian Authority saying such a hostile stance would not affect the nation\u2019s resolve to pursue its goals."}

{"sample_id": 52022, "text": "The Legal Aid Agency (LAA) has denied \u2018second guessing\u2019 legal aid lawyers and refusing funding applications for issues that should be determined in court. In an article by LegalVoice comment editor Fiona Bawdon published on Monday about concerns over the new and controversial CCMS digital billing system, a leading family law specialist complained about agency staff overstepping the mark. Cris McCurley cited the example of an application for public funding being refused on the basis that she shouldn\u2019t have applied for a wardship. \u2018I have raised this issue with the LAA so many times. The people who make these decisions have no legal training,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018We strongly disagree that practitioners are being \u201csecond guessed\u201d,\u2019 the LAA told LegalVoice in a statement. \u2018LAA staff carry out their statutory responsibility, as handed down by LASPO, and receive extensive and ongoing training in legal aid regulations. They make informed decisions based on the information provided by firms.\u2019 In relation to the wardship case, the LAA said that all cases were \u2018fact specific and without more details we are unable to provide a full reply\u2019.\nAhead of publication, Bawdon put a series of questions to the agency \u2013 see below \u2013 but no response was received until after the article appeared.\nThe LAA spokesman pointed out that since the CCMS became mandatory in April 2016 more than 88,000 civil legal aid applications had been processed and nearly half a million bills had been paid. \u2018Whenever users experience any technical difficulties, we have a contingency process is in place for the most urgent applications,\u2019 she said.\nLawyers who believe clients are being left in dangerous situations because of LAA delays are advised to phone its customer service team.\nThe MoJ last year attempted to introduce an \u2018embarrassment clause\u2019 threatening sanctions for bringing the LAA into disrepute in its crime contracts.\nLAA chief exec Shaun McNally has said he wants a more adult relationship with the profession. Does he feel progress is being made in that direction? \u2026 Practitioners say it is all but impossible to have anything approaching an adult relationship when there is such an imbalance of power. How do you respond to that concern?\nThe Chief Executive was referring to the strong long term relationships needed to develop and successfully implement legal aid access across England and Wales. In order to achieve this, it is vital that the legal profession and LAA is unified to ensure that access to justice is available to those who need it most.\nThe Chief Executive and his team have prioritised regular meetings with the relevant legal aid representative bodies and partners, and are making good progress in keeping these channels open.\nI have been told that delays and refusals are leaving children in dangerous situations. I appreciate you cannot comment on individual cases (or on the basis of such scant information) but what would you advise a practitioner in this situation to do?\nWe do not agree and without specific details we are unable to comment on anecdotal information. If a practitioner believes that such a situation is taking place then their first port of call should be the LAA Customer Service Team phone line on 0300 200 2020.\nExperience practitioners complain about being second guessed by LAA staff. An example I was given was of a child care lawyer whose application for legal aid was refused on the basis she shouldn\u2019t have applied for a wardship. The high court judge in the case granted the wardship, so her question to me (and the LAA) would be: \u2018What makes a non-lawyer at the LAA a better judge than the judge in the case?\u2019 Can you understand how frustrating and demoralising this must be?\nWe strongly disagree that practitioners are being \u2018second guessed\u2019. LAA staff carry out their statutory responsibility, as handed down by LASPO, and receive extensive and ongoing training in legal aid regulations. They make informed decisions based on the information provided by firms. In regard to the wardship case referred to, all cases are of course fact specific and without more details we are unable to provide a full reply.\nLawyers say they are nervous about speaking publicly about their experiences with CCMS for fear of some kind of backlash from the LAA. Could you give categorical assurance this would never be the case?\nWe understand the importance of a fully functioning and reliable CCMS to our customers. We are in constant dialogue with rep bodies and practitioners on CCMS, and encourage these groups to discuss how the system can be improved.\nLawyers complain that the well rehearsed problems with CCMS are compounded by greater refusals by LAA. Could you confirm whether the criteria staff are required to use in their decision making have changed at all? Also, some lawyers are convinced that LAA staff are being given incentives to refuse applications wherever possible. Could you confirm whether or not there is any such scheme in place?\nLAA staff carry out their statutory responsibility, as handed down by LASPO, by undertaking their role and making decisions based on the information provided by firms. CCMS has not altered our approach to decision making. It is wholly incorrect to imply that there is any incentive for staff to refuse applications.\nI am told there are problems with CCMS \u2018Claim Upload\u2019 facility and that there is currently only one external costs software provider offering this as other companies have withdrawn from trying to develop compatible packages, defeated by the problems they have encountered with CCMS. \u2026 Are you aware of these issues? Is it a matter of concern to the LAA if it remains the case that there is only one external provider of this facility?\nWe have received positive feedback on the current bulk upload facility from both providers and chambers and no issues have been reported by our end users. However, the LAA accept that the test system for Software Vendors needs to be updated and plans are in place to develop and replace the platform by the end of February 2017. This platform will mirror the live environment allowing the LAA to provide regular updates in order for vendors to develop and test their products.\nWe record and track user support communications and investigate any negative feedback received from a vendor. The LAA also attend the quarterly Legal Software Supplier Association (LSSA) meetings and encourages an open dialogue with all vendors. We aim to respond to any concerns raised directly with us."}

So far, it's smooth sailing around here (pun intended)!\nToday is Scrapbooking Saturday over at My Cricut Craft Room and I have a sweet layout to share with you. If you have visited my blog in the past, these photos may look familiar to you. I have used the same pictures in my scrapbook of Blake (my darling grandson). But today's layout of these photos is for the scrapbook I am working on for Blake's mommy! (And I wonder why I can never get caught up?). If you would like to see how I scrapped these photos in my book, click here.\nPatterned paper for this layout is from the Nantucket Stack from DCWV. Solid colors are from my paper stash...I was able to use up a few paper scraps on this one!\n* Martha Stewart punch for the red strip along the side and some white ric-rac.\n* Sailor Boy is cut using Alphalicious at 1.5 inches.\n* The compass is from Cricut's Pack Your Bags, cut at 3.5 inches, I added a silver brad to the center.\n* That awesome Martha Stewart punch and more ric-rac.\n* The anchor is from Life Is A Beach. I cut the anchor at 3.5 inches and added some red/white twine. I also added a few dots with a sliver gel pen.\n* I cut that cute sailboat form Life Is A Beach at 5.5 inches. A few stitching lines and silver brads really brought it to life! I used the same MS punch to create a few waves for my boat.\nI may have gotten a bit carried away with the ric-rac on this one, but I love the nautical feel it adds to the layout.\nDoesn't Blake make an adorable Sailor Boy? I hope you enjoyed my layout today! Thanks so much for stopping by, I always look forward to your visits and your sweet comments. I hope you will stop by My Cricut Craft Room and see what the other designers have in store for you today!\nAwesome LO and it helps that you have the most Cutest little baby to show it off.

{"sample_id": 59841, "text": "Hal Bibby, Juniper Distribution and Marketing Manager, is a generous soul and good for a yarn.\nThe accompanying info for the sample pack this wine was included in was preceded by a great summary (though perhaps that word itself undersells it) of the vintage conditions in Margs.\nBehold, to the wine in question, and from the get-go it truly is a riot of berry derived aromatics that sits over an underlying edge of spice, a nod to the 10% whole bunch inclusion.\nEven unto the palate, it's a soft and succulent wine initially, before more of that spice character makes itself very well know, with an assertiveness that almost masks some fine tannin on a decent tail of flavour.\n\"Wines made for eating\", nice tagline from the Hastwell and Lightfoot crew - a brand name I feel I've known for an age.\nInitially deep and dark, before the onset of lighter and brighter fruit sitting at its core. It's boysenberry, perhaps a suggestion of raspberry in the frame too.\nI'd paired this with some kebabs that we'd liberally introduced to some oregano, so that herbal - and Mediterranean - association ran long.\nBeautifully fragrant from Canberra District's Shaw Estate here. It's all manner of things, ranging from crisp green apple and kaffir lime, to a little bath salt and delicate soft tropical fruit.\nI'd personally be looking to harness those aromatics and marry to some spice, think Thai green mango salad or such, pack some heat, add some scallops even - for an Aussie take on a classic.\nAt 5g residual it's not sweet, but there's a little unfermented in there and that adds to the texture and body. Doubly adding to its case as a screamer for some chilli, in my humble.\nGrassy, citrus, over a milky sage like aroma. Certainly speaking of its lead component. Assertive acidity combined with the tropical nuances provide the wines initial energy.\nAlkoomi's White Label range offers some of the best value wines amongst their respective varieties. This Sauvignon Blanc no exception, offering what the variety does from the cool Frankland River region in Western Australia's South-East corner.\nPlays a strong aromatic hand; by way of creamy apple, fresh podded pea and a citrus meets vanilla aspect.\nThe aromatics are where its strengths lie, there's a textural fullness to the wine, but seemingly at the expense of further flavour and presence.\nFrom 6th generation winemaker Trent Burge, honouring the region and the variety for which it's renowned.\nDeep set, plum, evocative, richly expressive. Hints of nut, coconut even - not so much swathed or swaddled in oak, but that's there too with its come hither coffee and vanilla ways. Framed, perhaps is how one sees it."}

{"sample_id": 19273, "text": "\"I won't be King of Manchester. I will be God of Manchester.\"\nAlthough three matches is surely too small of a sample size to measure soccer holiness, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has at least backed up his latest self-fulfilling prophecy thus far.\nManchester United's free summer signing has already scored the winning goal of the Community Shield, found the back of the net in his Premier League debut and bagged a brace in his first Old Trafford appearance.\nAlong the way, Ibrahimovic's best traits have been highlighted, proving that his finishing, physicality and fight still outweigh his age, and make him a perfect fit in another Jose Mourinho-led team.\nIn Friday's 2-0 win over Southampton, he towered over opposing defender Jose Fonte to nod home United's opening goal, before sealing the deal by converting a second half penalty.\nWhereas Wayne Rooney would've been trusted to take the spot shot in years past, Zlatan has already claimed his crown as the team's assigned scorer, which is nothing new for the Swede.\nAfter 38 goals in his final Ligue 1 season, it remains to be seen how the comparatively longer, and certainly more competitive, English schedule will wear on the 34-year-old, but he's immediately established himself as a top fantasy striking option, which should come as no surprise to him.\nWhile Ibrahimovic and his newest teammate Paul Pogba have deservedly claimed their fair share of headlines lately, the Pep Guardiola Era at Manchester City has certainly provided plenty of talking points as well.\nThe former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss drew attention from his defensive player selections in Gameweek 1, but the signature attacking style of his teams has come to the forefront since.\nThe Citizens stomped Steaua Bucuresti 5-0 in a midweek Champions League performance led by striker Sergio Aguero and wide man Nolito, and that duo did the business for Man City once again at the weekend.\nIn beating Stoke City 4-1, Aguero got his team's first two goals, bringing his tally to six through City's first three competitive fixtures.\nThe Argentine's output isn't unexpected for someone with 50 Premier League goals over the past two seasons, but newcomer Nolito's second half brace at Stoke should especially attract fantasy owners.\nUnlike underwhelming La Liga imports Pedro and Jesus Navas, Nolito has found comfort in England from being reunited with Guardiola, who coached him in both Barcelona's senior and B side during his time at the club from 2008 to 2011.\nAlthough Guardiola ultimately allowed Nolito's development to continue elsewhere, it's no wonder why he's naturally fit the desired style at Man City. In 170 minutes for the Citizens, Nolito already boasts three goals and one assist.\nThat follows his 37 goals and 22 assists over his last three seasons in Spain, showing that even though Nolito was a late bloomer, he's seemingly already suited to impress under Guardiola in England.\nSpeaking of solid first impressions, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte's Italian flare for the dramatic has been another immediately evident item. The intense tactician led his country to particularly pulsating victories over Belgium and Spain this summer, focusing on strict organization and opportune offensive exploits. Although Chelsea's defense still needs tightening, striker Diego Costa has taken brilliantly to Conte's desired ruthlessness on the pitch.\nAfter clinching Chelsea's last-gasp opening win against West Ham in the 89th minute, Costa found the back of the net with an 87th-minute winner Saturday at Watford. In doing so, he notched his 12th goal in 21 competitive appearances for Chelsea in 2016.\nWith a yellow card on both occasions this season as well, Costa appears to be the embodiment of Conte's requirements, something that could carter toward continued fantasy success.\nAlong with the individual offseason additions of Ibrahimovic, Nolito and Conte to England, the Premier League's three new teams flourished in Gameweek 2.\nBurnley beat Liverpool 2-0 and Middlesbrough saw out Sunderland 2-1, but the most impressive promoted side so far has been Hull City.\nThe Tigers not only beat defending champions Leicester City on the opening day, but also won 2-0 at Swansea City on Saturday. After that result, only Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea can match Hull's 100 percent record to date. Sure, it's incredibly early in the season, but Hull's surprising start has to be commended \u2013 as do a few of their fantasy standouts.\nStriker Abel Hernandez has supplied a goal and an assist already, yet Hull's best bargains may lie in defense. Thanks to injured teammate Allan McGregor, goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic has started between the sticks, recording seven saves and allowing just one goal. What's more, though, is that Jakupovic costs merely \u00a34.0m in the Premier League's official fantasy game, making him as cheap as they come at his position.\nThat standing makes Jakupovic a perfect piece to fill out fantasy squads for as long as he starts, especially if center back Curtis Davies continues to be a colossus in front of him. Through the Tigers' first two games, Davies has averaged eight interceptions, nine clearances and 2.5 blocks per match. The veteran also assisted Hull's first goal at Swansea by winning an aerial duel off a corner kick. Overall, Davies' instrumental opening makes him someone to consider most closely in daily fantasy formats, even if his Gameweek 3 matchup against Manchester United and the aforementioned Ibrahimovic presents his tallest task yet."}

It made sense to pack up my gear and make a trip out of it. I\u2019d stop each day at a destination, to ride or paddle and move on.\nHelpful in planning my route was Garmin Basecamp, Riderplanet.com and Bing Maps. My gear consisted of a Husqvarna TE 310 R, SIC Maui X-14 Pro, and a Specialized Epic MTB. Lake or mountain trails were destinations I needed to find daily. First day out was Flagstaff, Arizona, as I had done this route last fall and provides cooler temps at altitude and 2 great trail networks north and south of town open to dirt bikes and mtb.\nThis time instead of a direct route to Durango, went east and up to Santa Fe for a night. Great place to relax for the night and morning as I planned to ride up to 60 miles near Taos on the Husky.\nCouncil Bluffs Lake, Madison, Wis., and into Sheboygan, Wis., my furthest east destination.\nReturning I tracked further north towards the Black Hills, then Cheyenne, Dillon, Fruita and Ouray, Colorado.\nOver the last weekend I took a trip to South Lake Tahoe to compete in The Race the Lake of the Sky, one of the biggest events of the summer season. Had planned to race this event for a couple of years but had not, so planned and trained for the sunday distance race which would be 14+ miles.\nAlso planned to check out the motorcycle riding opportunities in Mammoth and Tahoe and brought the Husqvarna as well as the SIC Maui X-14 Pro SUP. Arrived Friday in Mammoth and had enough time to grab lunch, check out Lake Mary and decide what the plan for the afternoon would be. Decided to check into Motel 6, unload the bike, and ride to the trails.\nRight off the main drag in town is the Shady Rest Park. After 1/4 mile or so in, the road turns to dirt and becomes a 4\u00d74 route. Further in, trails go in different directions, to June Lake, Mono or Mammoth trail/loop. I headed towards June Lake initially till a steep blind downhill. Figured starting late it was better to not chance getting surprised so turned around and rode the Mammoth loop.\nHad dinner at Perry\u2019s across the street and left early Saturday for Tahoe. Arrived at noon to a packed event and limited parking for 5 blocks. Hung out at the beach up the road and relaxed before checking in at my motel for the night.\nI had planned to train through this race. My distance training has come very late. Only paddled 14 miles this year two weeks ago, and 10 a few days later. Bad sinus issues have kept me from pushing hard since January with a flue as well. I\u2019ve just not been feeling 100% with getting winded quickly, vertigo, etc\u2026 Doing the distance at a pace I can sustain while keeping my heart rate in check was the goal. All worked out as I envisioned except for my early course misjudgement which caused me to paddle an extra .4 miles on the first leg. Never paddled this race before\u2026 I heard from a team mate the bay was over there and so that\u2019s where I aimed. Was the wrong bay :-/ I hoped that the wind would build and not hurt me too badly. In the end 8th place in 50+ 14 ft. Happy with that considering my expectations and level of fitness. Good to see Braly and Brad and a large group at the SIC Maui Tent. Also good to see many NorCal competitors I have not seen for a year or two. And then there is the SoCal group I see all the time."}

Rooms that are sun-filled during the day require soft, diffused illumination at night. Choose dimmable portable lamps for general illumination. Additional task or accent lighting may be tastefully delivered with decorative reading lamps and stylish mini-pendants.\n\u2013 Protect and Preserve the Natural and Super-natural: Choose shielded fixtures and natural textures to work with the changing degrees light. Look for outside lighting products that are \u201cDark Sky\u201d compliant*, energy-efficient and durable.\n\u2013 Be Bold Where it Counts: Pops of color can change the vibe of a room and bring new life to the d\u00e9cor. Select lamps that express your unique taste and aesthetic vision. The latest finishes abound with imaginative color combinations and inventive structural compositions.\n\u2013 Knowledge Defies Superstition: Thoughtfully chosen fixtures are the key to favorable results.

{"sample_id": 23964, "text": "One of early Christianity's most carefully crafted sermons, the Epistle to the Hebrews addresses listeners who have experienced the elation of conversion and the heat of hostility, but who now must confront the formidable task of remaining faithful in a society that rejects their commitments. The letter probes into the one of most profound questions of faith: If it is God's will that believers be crowned with glory and honor, why are the faithful subject to suffering and shame? Through the stories of Abraham and Sarah, Moses, and Rahab, whose faith enabled them to overcome severe trials and conflicts, and through the story of Jesus himself, whose sufferings opened the way to God's presence for all, the sermon confirms the foundations of the Christian faith.\nIn a magisterial introduction, Koester presents a compelling portrait of the early Christian community and examines the debates that have surrounded the Epistle to the Hebrews for two millennia. Drawing on his knowledge of classical rhetoric, he clarifies the book's arguments and discusses the use of evocative language and imagery to appeal to its audience's minds, emotions, and will. Providing an authoritative, accessible discussion of the book's high priestly Christology, this landmark commentary charts new directions for the interpretation of Epistle to the Hebrews and its influence on Christian theology and worship.\nCraig R. Koester is Professor of New Testament at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. He is the author of Symbolism in the Fourth Gospel, The Dwelling of God, and Revelation and the End of All Things, as well as numerous articles for scholarly and professional journals."}

{"sample_id": 27303, "text": "African mega-fauna is often neatly divided between the predators and the prey. The predators \u2013 lions, cheetah, leopards, wild dogs, hyena, jackal, etc. live primarily by hunting and eating the prey \u2013 antelope, rabbits, squirrels, even giraffes and elephants occasionally.\nPredators have their eyes directed forward to better stalk their prey. They live a primarily sedentary life, generally sleeping in the shade, between hunts. Prey have their eyes located at the sides of their heads to help them see approaching predators. They are constantly on the lookout, often in motion and tend to live in herds. When they graze, they usually have a \u201cscout\u201d watching for predators approaching. It\u2019s an interesting dynamic to watch.\nOur guides are very in tune with animal behaviors. Multiple vultures in a tree indicate a carcass nearby for example. One evening we were returning to camp just after dark when we heard impala making loud sounds and running parallel to our safari vehicle. Our driver quickly stopped, turned around, drove about 50 feet, shown the spotlight into the shrubbery and highlighted a leopard. Wow! He knew what had frightened the impala and exactly where the predator (in this case a leopard) would be.\nThe Big Five, so-named because these were the desired trophy kills, could be divided this way: predators \u2013 lions and leopards, prey \u2013 Cape buffalo, elephant and rhinoceros. These magnificent animals have been hunted nearly to extinction, but many are coming back. We\u2019ve seen many examples of the beautiful lions and leopards in the parks we\u2019ve visited. Elephants, though rare in some areas are plentiful in others, with more than 50,000 in Chobe National Park alone. Cape Buffalo abound. Only rhinos are still seriously endangered because of poaching.

{"sample_id": 24498, "text": "The blogging industry is unlike any other I have ever been a part of. It\u2019s fast-paced and a dream job in so many aspects, but with all of the excitement and exposure comes added responsibility to be more mindful of what you are creating on the Internet. Right now our industry is at a tipping point. Blogging content has gotten so repetitive and contrived. Hearing the word \u201cinfluencer\u201d is like nails on a chalkboard. Some how, an industry that began with the best intentions\u2013to share authentic stories from far-flung places around the world\u2013has become an industry that is sometimes difficult for me to identify with. But we as creators have the power to change it. If I can impart any wisdom from my successes and missteps in the blogging industry it would be the following eleven tips for being a more mindful blogger or influencer. New bloggers especially, please read on.\nDon\u2019t become a walking billboard. If every single Instagram post is sponsored, how do you expect your audience to really trust what you are telling them?\nBe aware of blogger burnout. You WILL get burnt out if you go nonstop on social. It\u2019s just a matter of how and when. When this happens your creativity will suffer. Take breaks. Go dark. Your fans will still be there when you get back.\nSpeaking of creativity \u2013 go outside of the box. Way outside. Stop posing or vlogging like you think a blogger should. You are an artist and you have a blank canvas. Create content that feeds your soul. That is the only way this industry will experience a shift.\nStop breakfast goals: Real talk about breakfast spreads with 25 plates for one person\u2026what is happening to all of the food we don\u2019t eat? Hotel/restaurant staff is not allowed to eat food once it has been plated so it\u2019s likely going straight into the garbage. Who is with me in eliminating those \u201cbreakfast goals\u201d photos altogether? Or if you are going to order the entire menu, ask for it to be boxed up and take it out to the street where I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a hungry person who will gladly eat your avo toast, blueberry pancakes and eggs Benedict.\nDon\u2019t celebrate followers and likes. Celebrate experiences and authenticity. Lately I\u2019ve seen hotels throwing bloggers big bashes when they reach a certain threshold of followers. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but elaborate \u201cfollower\u201d celebrations feel icky to me. Partly because so many bloggers have botted and bought their way to the top. And partly because, in my opinion, we should be celebrating innovative ideas and creative expression. If you reach 100,000 followers and a hotel wants to throw you a party, why not ask them to donate that money to your favorite charity instead?\nBe mindful of how much time you are spending editing one photo. What could you do with that time if you weren\u2019t a slave to Lightroom? Set a limit for yourself.\nStop comparing yourself to other bloggers. So much of what you see is smoke and mirrors. Nobody has it all together. Everybody is insecure about something. One of my favorite quotes as it relates to this industry is by Theodore Roosevelt. He said, \u201cComparison is the death of joy.\u201d Just do you!\nEliminate the ego. Instagram is the most narcissistic destination I have ever been to. You can help shift that mentality by sharing more stories and experiences of the people you encounter, or brands that have a really beautiful mission. Or even if you are posting a photo of you, use the caption as an opportunity to spread a message that will make people think or trigger a dialogue.\nDon\u2019t rely solely on Instagram as your career. What if one day someone pulls the plug? Then what? Set yourself up for success by having a well-rounded resume that doesn\u2019t lead off with \u201cInstagrammer\u201d or \u201cInfluencer\u201d.\nAdvocate for your work. Get paid. The blogging industry has often been referred to as the \u201cWild West\u201d when it comes to payment terms and infrastructure. So many bloggers work for barter that it drives down the industry as a whole. A brand can always find a content creator who will do it for cheaper or for free so why would they pay you to do it? In order to change this we all most approach blogging as a business and eliminate the notion that bloggers should work for free. Here\u2019s a perfect example, if a hotel hires a production company to shoot a new advertisement for their hotel, there would be no question that the film crew get\u2019s flown to the destination and the production company would get paid a substantial fee to shoot, edit and license the video for commercial use. But for some reason it is assumed that you would execute that very some project for free as a blogger. There is a double standard that has to change.\nTrust your intuition. Don\u2019t just post something for the sake of a like or to make a brand happy.\nI hope this post sparks some dialogue. It\u2019s as much a list for me to refer back to and know that I\u2019m on the right track as it is advice for others. I am by no means the perfect content creator and I have definitely contributed my fair share of bad content throughout the years. One of the best parts of the blogging community is that we can learn so much from each other and define the next generation of blogging on our own terms. What does that look like for you?\nThis article really got me thinking about my own Instagram. I had started posting more of the behind-the-scenes photos with no editing at all, which seems to get quite a bit of engagement. I\u2019ve come to realize that this is what my audience wants to see. Because of this, I now refuse to spend time editing a photo that looks good without the editing. Thank you for the kick in the figurative pants I needed to make sure I don\u2019t go down that rabbit hole again!\nWonderful! I\u2019m not an influencer but I understand all the points you made. I worry about all the millennial who are going broke trying to sustain a lifestyle far too big for their bank accounts. I recently had lunch with 5 food bloggers (75k+ followers) and they were thrilled to have the chance to get real with each other. They are exhausted, burned out. They\u2019ve been so busy getting just the right shot that they aren\u2019t aware of the shifts the people now want. Algorithm changes and a huge influx of more wannabe luxury travelers and good bloggers are drowning everyone out. Finding their brand voice is difficult all of a sudden in a world of copycats. Yes, \u201cVomparison is the thief of joy\u201d. Keeping up with the Jones\u2019s is at a whole new level."}

The matches were filled with thrills, as some of the best competitors in the world fought hard to secure a spot in the gold medal matches. Here\u2019s how each bracket played out.\nThe biggest name on the ticket, Leandro Lo got a bye in the first round and had to compete only twice to reach the final. He first outscored John Combs 6-2 and then met up with well-known rival Keenan Cornelius, who had just beat Tim Spriggs in the quarterfinals. The clash was a tough one for Lo, but eventually he was able to build a 7-2 lead that granted him a ticket to the final.\nOn the other side of the bracket, with no clear favorite, the field was wide open for a challenge to the title. GF Team\u2019s Guttemberg Pereira was the one who took it. In three matches, he first beat Mahamed Aly 3-0 on advantages to reach the quarterfinals where he locked horns with Fellipe Andrew, caught in a toehold. The semifinal was against Tommy Langkaker, also finished, but with a choke from the back.\nThe big final goes on at the end of the day this Sunday.\nLuiza Monteiro and Bianca Bas\u00edlio rose above expectations to reach the final. In three matches for each competitor, they were able to go through very tough competition. Luiza started out catching Sabatha Santos with a toehold while Bia finished Jena Bishop with a ankle lock.\nIn the quarterfinals, Luiza met up with Andressa Cintra and again worked her guard game to find a leglock. Bia, on the other hand, found a narrow lead by one advantage over Jessica Flowers to reach the semifinals.\nThe two matches that defined the finalists featured Luiza facing Bia Mesquita and Bianca facing Nathiely de Jesus. It\u2019s safe to say Mesquita and Nathiely were favorites for the chance to fight for the gold medal, but Luiza and Bianca couldn\u2019t care less about that and went for it hard. In two very close matches, Luiza beat Bia by advantages and Bas\u00edlio beat Nathiely via disqualification for fleeing the mat area.\nThe gold medal match goes on right before the men\u2019s final, this Sunday afternoon.\nReport brought to you by Gameness."}

Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and anywhere else you listen to podcasts.\nThe day before President Trump\u2019s rambling Rose Garden remarks announcing a national emergency on our southern border, I sat down with Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). All that was needed was for Congress to vote on the budget deal to avert another government shutdown and send the legislation to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. And Bass was clear-eyed about what Trump\u2019s theater was masking.\nBass\u2019s first visit to the podcast came just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017. A time when the Los Angeles Democrat said her town halls had turned her into a \u201cpolitical therapist.\u201d That all changed, Bass said, when she put anxiety into action.\nSo I asked Bass, who was part of a small CBC delegation that met with the president in March 2017, how successful the caucus could be in thwarting him and achieving its goals with Trump in the White House. \u201cWith 55 people and the amount of power that we have on a committee and subcommittee level, it\u2019s all very doable,\u201d she said. CBC members now chair the committees on homeland security, financial services, oversight and reform, education and labor, and science, space and technology.\nListen to the podcast to hear Bass talk more about Trump, the Democratic Party and her thoughts on the freshman House member everyone can\u2019t seem to stop talking about: \u201cAOC,\u201d Rep.

Absolutely!\nThe above is just a preface to what I am posting below.\nIt is an excerpt from Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s musings and research on creativity.\nbut I highly recommend watching the entire 20 minute video.\nThe link is posted at the bottom.\nElizabeth Gilbert talks about a meeting with the US poet Ruth Stone.\nAmerican poet Ruth Stone who is now in her 90s, but she\u2019s been a poet her entire life.\nShe told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the field, and she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. She said it was like a thunderous train of air, and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. When she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet, she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, in her words, was to run like hell. She would run like hell to the house, and she\u2019d be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.\nOther times she wouldn\u2019t be fast enough. So she\u2019d be running and running and running, and she wouldn\u2019t get to the house, and the poem would barrel through her, and she said that she would miss it, and the poem would continue across the landscape looking, as she put it, for another poet.\nThen there were the times where, this is the piece that I never forgot, there were moments where she would almost miss it, and she\u2019s running into the house and she\u2019s looking for the paper, and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it\u2019s going through her. Then she said she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it, She would catch the poem by it\u2019s tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page, and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact to the word, but backwards from the last word to the first\u201d.\nHenri Cartier-Bresson\u2019s, \u201cThe Decisive Moment\u201d has always influenced my style of photography.\nIt is a snap shot, voyeuristic image of a simple, but somehow glorified world.\nWhat appeals most to me about this style, is that something unspectacular may have happened right before, and may again be pedestrian right after, but at the millisecond the shutter is released, a captivating moment is caught.\nHowever, what if the image is not just an instant frozen in time?\nWhat if everything leading up to, and continuing after, is just as mesmerizing?\nor show the nuance that led to a kiss?\nwhere I have always felt the whole story of a moment could be told.\nabout the movement in the moments.\nI am certainly just a freshman in this world of filmmaking, but am committed to continuing my studies!\nBelow is the ending of the montage that I did for my son\u2019s 8th grade class graduation.\nI used a medium-end consumer digital video camera, I can\u2019t wait to use a higher-end camera like the big boys!\nNew year, new President, time to get back to work.\nthat I have been able to find over the last ten years!\nOf course, I do have my Photoshop guru\u2019s\u2026Brian, Russell, and Jack.\nand I find that there is quite a lot that I don\u2019t need to know.\nAs with all things Internet, there are tutorials on every aspect of Photoshop.\nand step-by-step tutorials to teach innumerable techniques.\nBelow is one of my favorite \u201cPhotoshopped\u201d images!\nand what a perfect day to begin to blog."}

{"sample_id": 22322, "text": "Street Fight\u2019s latest report on local merchants, Strategies for Selling Marketing & Technology Services, posted today. It\u2019s a companion piece to our annual survey of local small and medium-sized businesses, that focuses on vendor strategies for selling local marketing services and up-selling add-ons or suites of offerings.\nStreet Fight surveyed over 250 local merchants on their marketing and e-commerce usage, effectiveness, and challenges. Over 40% of local merchants we surveyed said they would increase their social media spending. Similarly, email marketing and local sites will see bigger budgets, according to 36% of those polled. Very few said they\u2019d cut back on any of the digital categories we offered.\nRegular Street Fight contributors David Mihm and Mike Blumenthal have written a series of posts on the ideal digital marketing starter kits for SMBs. Their package would collect a website, listings management with directory support, email, review solicitation and management, and Facebook and Instagram ads for $150 per month. Paid search and managed social presence would be add-ons. This approach matches the digital marketing tactic adoption patterns our survey showed, although it ignores traditional media and direct mail.\nStreet Fight\u2019s survey showed a pattern of momentum spending, i.e., the more a local merchant spent on marketing, the more likely he was to increase. And that pattern held true regardless of budget. So it\u2019s worthwhile for a supplier to get in early and grow along with the customer. Still, the best targets spend more than $25,000 annually, and comprise a little under a third of the survey respondents. They use a broader variety of channels, media, and management services.\nAnd while it\u2019s desirable to be a one-stop provider of a suite of marketing services \u2013 both for revenue volume and customer lock-in, as well as for the customer\u2019s ease of integration and campaign coordination and optimization \u2013 it appears that most local merchants already work with multiple suppliers and are fairly comfortable doing so.\nThe figure above shows that the plurality of local merchants work with three or more suppliers or agencies, and that figure is three-quarters for those with bigger marketing budgets. The average local merchant we surveyed works with 2.7 suppliers, and if you strip out those that say they do it themselves, that rises to 3.7. From an attitude perspective, the plurality (40%) said they preferred to work with multiple companies to get the best solution or price.\nOn average, survey respondents said they need the most help with search: with SEO (50% of all respondents) more than with paid search (33%), as far more have websites than use AdWords. Another 29% cited social media needs \u2013 reputations monitoring and review generation \u2013 as among their Top 3 needs.\nThe figure above shows that those local merchants with larger budgets need help even more than the little guys, and on a broader area of marketing tactics.\nOur analysis suggests it\u2019s wise for suppliers to aim to add services to or integrate programs and campaigns with the two most prominent tactics: social media and email. There also may be rich opportunities in selling them social video services, direct mail programs, and local broadcast media.\nThe top digital marketing objective for the average local merchant is new customer acquisition, but many are also highly interested in customer service. Social video and direct mail could complement email for this.\nThe new report presents \u201ccheat sheets\u201d based on attitudes and marketing adoption patterns to help with positioning and selling local technologies and services to local merchants."}

I\u2019m also pretty flexible in terms of which florals I like, harbouring soft spots for both the simple solifores and big buxom bouquets that announce themselves with a large degree of bombast.\nCrabtree & Evelyn (a brand that I\u2019m not overly familiar with) have released a Heritage Collection, in which they have launched three floral waters that hark back to the golden age of perfumery. These three floral eau de toilettes \u2013 Florentine Freesia, Old World Jasmine and Venetian Violet \u2013 are more than just simple floral ditties and feel surprisingly well done for the price.\nThis week\u2019s Escentual post is a review of my two favourites from the collection (Old World Jasmine and Florentine Freesia), both of which present their respective flowers in interesting ways.

I feel they are too expensive for what they are and was shocked when the sales assistant told me they were \u00a3140 for 100ml \u2013 very non Crabtree & Evelyn prices! She then proceeded to tell me that the company had compared their new fragrances to the likes or Dior and Chanel etc and they feel that the prices reflect the quality \u2013 I\u2019m not so sure. You can purchase a bottle of Dior collection privee for less!\nJeez! That\u2019s a lot of money for Crabtree & Evelyn!"}
